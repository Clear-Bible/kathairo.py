\v 38 which Yahweh commanded Moses on Mount Sinai on the day of his commanding the sons of Israel to present their offerings to Yahweh in the wilderness of Sinai.

\p
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 2 “Take Aaron and his sons with him and the clothes and the oil of anointing and the bull of the sin offering and two rams and a basket of unleavened bread. 
\v 3 And assemble the whole congregation at the entrance of the tent of meeting.”

\ts\* 
\v 4 And Moses did just as Yahweh commanded him. And the congregation assembled at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

\p
\v 5 And Moses said to the congregation, “This {is} the thing that Yahweh commanded to do.”

\ts\*
\v 6 Moses presented Aaron and his sons, and he washed them with water. 
\v 7 And he gave the tunic on him and he wrapped him with the sash and he clothed him {with} the robe and he gave the ephod on him. And he wrapped him with the finely woven waistband of the ephod and he fastened {the ephod} on him with it.

\ts\* 
\v 8 And he placed the breastplate on him and he gave the Urim and the Thummim to the breastplate. 
\v 9 And he placed the turban on his head and he placed on the turban—to the front of its face—the plate of gold, the crown of holiness, just as Yahweh commanded Moses.

\ts\*
\p
\v 10 And Moses took the oil of anointing, and  he anointed the Dwelling and all that {was} in it. And he made them holy. 
\v 11 And he sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times and he anointed the altar and all its utensils and the basin and its base to make them holy.

\ts\* 
\v 12 And he poured some of the oil of anointing on the head of Aaron and he anointed him to make him holy. 
\v 13 And Moses presented the sons of Aaron, and he clothed them {with} tunics and he wrapped them {with} sashes and he bound headbands on them, just as Yahweh commanded Moses.

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And he brought the bull of the sin offering near. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering. 
\v 15 And he slaughtered {it}, and Moses took the blood, and he gave {it} on the horns of the altar all around with his finger. And he purified the altar and he poured out the blood at the base of the altar. And he made it holy to make atonement on it.

\ts\* 
\v 16 And he took all the fat that {was} on the innards and the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat, and Moses caused {them} to become smoke on the altar. 
\v 17 But the bull and its skin and its meat and its dung he burned with fire on the outside of the camp, just as Yahweh commanded Moses.

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And he presented the ram of the burnt offering. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. 
\v 19 And he slaughtered {it}, and Moses splashed the blood on the altar all around.

\ts\* 
\v 20 And he cut the ram into its pieces, and Moses caused the head and the pieces and the suet to become smoke. 
\v 21 But the innards and the legs he washed with water. And Moses caused the whole ram to become smoke on the altar. It {was} a burnt offering, a pleasant smell. It {was} a gift to Yahweh, just as Yahweh commanded Moses.

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And he presented the second ram, the ram of the ordination offering. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. 
\v 23 And he slaughtered {it}, and Moses took some of its blood, and he gave {it} on the earlobe of the right ear of Aaron and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot. 
\v 24 And he presented the sons of Aaron, and Moses gave some of the blood on the earlobe of their right ear and on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot. And Moses splashed the blood on the altar all around.

\ts\* 
\v 25 And he took the fat and the fatty tail and all the fat that {was} on the innards and the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and the right thigh. 
\v 26 And from the basket of the unleavened bread that {was} to the face of Yahweh, he took one loaf of unleavened bread and one loaf of bread of oil and one wafer and he placed them on the fat and on the right thigh. 
\v 27 And he gave the whole on the palms of Aaron and on the palms of his sons and he waved them {as} a wave offering to the face of Yahweh.

\ts\* 
\v 28 And Moses took them from on their hands, and he caused {them} to become smoke on the altar, on the burnt offering. They {were} an ordination offering, a pleasant smell. It {was} a gift to Yahweh. 
\v 29 And Moses took the breast, and he waved it {as} a wave offering to the face of Yahweh from the ram of the ordination offering. It {was} for Moses for a portion, just as Yahweh commanded Moses.

\ts\*
\p
\v 30 And Moses took some of the oil of anointing and some of the blood that {was} on the altar, and he sprinkled {them} on Aaron, on his clothes and on his sons and on the clothes of his sons with him. And he made holy Aaron, his clothes and his sons and the clothes of his sons with him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 31 And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, “Boil the meat at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and there you shall eat it and the bread that {is} in the basket of the ordination offering, just as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it.’ 
\v 32 But the remainder among the meat and among the bread you shall burn in the fire. 
\v 33 And you shall not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting {for} seven days, until the day of the filling of the days of your ordination, because {for} seven days, he will fill your hand.

\ts\* 
\v 34 Just as he did on this day, Yahweh commanded to do, to make atonement for you. 
\v 35 And at the entrance of the tent of meeting you shall stay day and night {for} seven days and you shall keep the watch of Yahweh and you will not die, because thus I have been commanded.”

\p
\v 36 And Aaron and his sons did all the things that Yahweh commanded by the hand of Moses.

\c 9
\p
\v 1 And it was, on the eighth day, Moses called to Aaron and to his sons and to the elders of Israel. 
\v 2 And he said to Aaron, “Take for yourself a calf, a son of the cattle, for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, perfect, and present {them} to the face of Yahweh.

\ts\* 
\v 3 And to the sons of Israel, you will speak, saying, ‘Take a buck of the goats for a sin offering and a calf and a lamb, perfect sons of a year, for a burnt offering, 
\v 4 and an ox and a ram for peace offerings to sacrifice to the face of Yahweh, and a grain offering mixed with oil, for today Yahweh will appear to you.’”

\p
\v 5 And they brought that which Moses commanded to the face of the tent of meeting. And the whole congregation presented {them}, and they stood to the face of Yahweh.

\ts\* 
\v 6 And Moses said, “This {is} the thing that Yahweh commanded you will do, and the glory of Yahweh will appear to you.”

\p
\v 7 And Moses said to Aaron, “Draw near to the altar and make your sin offering and your burnt offering and make atonement for the benefit of yourself and for the benefit of the people. And make the offering of the people and make atonement for their benefit, just as Yahweh commanded.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And Aaron drew near to the altar, and he slaughtered the calf of the sin offering, which {was} for himself. 
\v 9 And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and he gave {it} on the horns of the altar. And the blood he poured out at the base of the altar.
\ts\* 
\v 10 And the fat and the kidneys and the lobe from the liver from the sin offering he caused to become smoke on the altar, just as Yahweh commanded Moses. 
\v 11 But the meat and the skin he burned with fire on the outside of the camp.

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 And he slaughtered the burnt offering. And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him, and he splashed it on the altar all around. 
\v 13 And the burnt offering they brought to him in its pieces and the head, and he caused {them} to become smoke on the altar. 
\v 14 And he washed the innards and the legs and he caused {them} to become smoke on the burnt offering, on the altar.

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 And he presented the offering of the people. And he took the goat of the sin offering that {was} for the people and he slaughtered it and he offered it as a sin offering, like the first.

\p
\v 16 And he presented the burnt offering and he did it according to the regulation. 
\v 17 And he presented the grain offering and he filled his palm from it and he caused {it} to become smoke on the altar in addition to the burnt offering of the morning.

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And he slaughtered the ox and the ram of the sacrifice of the peace offerings that {were} for the people. And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him, and he splashed it on the altar all around. 
\v 19 And the fat from the bull and from the ram, the fatty tail and that which covers {the innards} and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver—

\ts\* 
\v 20 they put the fat on the breasts, and he caused the fat portions to become smoke on the altar. 
\v 21 And the breasts and the right thigh, Aaron waved {as} a wave offering to the face of Yahweh, just as Moses had commanded.

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And Aaron lifted his hands toward the people, and he blessed them. And he came down from making the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings. 
\v 23 And Moses and Aaron came into the tent of meeting, and they went out, and they blessed the people. And the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the people. 
\v 24 And fire went out from before the face of Yahweh, and it consumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar. And all the people saw, and they shouted and they fell on their faces.


\ts\*

\c 10
\p
\v 1 And the sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, each took his censer, and they gave fire in them and they put incense on it. And they offered to the face of Yahweh strange fire that he did not command them. 
\v 2 And fire went out from before the face of Yahweh, and it consumed them. And they died to the face of Yahweh.

\ts\* 
\v 3 And Moses said to Aaron, ”This is what Yahweh spoke, saying,
\q ‘Among those who draw near to me, I will show myself to be holy. And on the faces of all the people, I will be honored.’”
\p
\m And Aaron was silent. \v 4 And Moses called to Mishael and to Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron. And he said to them, “Present {yourselves and} lift your brothers from the face of the Holy Place to {a place} on the outside of the camp.”

\ts\* 
\v 5 And they presented {themselves} and they lifted them by their tunics to {a place} on the outside of the camp, just as Moses had spoken.

\p
\v 6 And Moses said to Aaron and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, “Do not let your heads be loose and do not tear your clothes so that you will not die and against all the congregation he will {not} be angry. But your brothers, all of the house of Israel, shall weep {for} the burning that Yahweh has burned. 
\v 7 And from the entrance of the tent of meeting, you shall not go out, lest you die, for the oil of the anointing of Yahweh {is} on you.” And they did according to the word of Moses.

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And Yahweh spoke to Aaron, saying, 
\v 9 “Wine or beer do not drink, you or your sons with you, when you go into the tent of meeting, and you will not die—an enduring statute throughout your generations— 
\v 10 and to separate between the holy and between the common and between the unclean and between the clean, 
\v 11 and to teach the sons of Israel all the statutes that Yahweh has spoken to them by the hand of Moses.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his remaining sons, “Take the grain offering, the remainder from the gifts of Yahweh, and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for it is a holy thing of the holy things. 
\v 13 And you shall eat it in a holy place because it {is} your portion and the portion of your sons from the gifts of Yahweh because thus I have been commanded. 

\ts\* 
\v 14 And the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution you shall eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you, for they are given {as} your portion and the portion of your sons from the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the sons of Israel. 
\v 15 The thigh of the contribution and the breast of the wave offering, in addition to the gifts of the fat portions, they shall bring to wave {as} a wave offering to the face of Yahweh. And it shall be for you and for your sons with you as an enduring portion, just as Yahweh commanded.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 16 And the goat of the sin offering Moses, searching, searched for. But look! It had been burned up! And he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the remaining sons of Aaron, saying, 
\v 17 “Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, for it is a holy thing of holy things? And he gave it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them to the face of Yahweh. 
\v 18 Look, its blood was not brought into the inner Holy Place. Eating, you shall eat it in the holy place, just as I commanded!”

\ts\*
\p
\v 19 And Aaron spoke to Moses, “Look, today they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering to the face of Yahweh, and it has happened to me according to these things. But {if} I ate the sin offering today, would it have been good in the eyes of Yahweh?” 
\v 20 And Moses heard, and it was good in his eyes.

\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them,

\ts\* 
\v 3 Anything dividing a hoof and splitting the cleft of hooves, making the cud go up among the livestock—you shall eat it. 
\v 4 However, this you shall not eat from the ones that are making the cud go up or from the ones that are dividing a hoof: the camel, because it is making the cud go up but a hoof it is not dividing. It {is} unclean to you.

\v 5 And the rock badger, because it is making the cud go up, but it does not divide a hoof. It {is} unclean to you.

\v 44 And Moses announced the appointed times of Yahweh to the sons of Israel.

\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 2 “Command the sons of Israel and they will bring to you pure beaten oil of the olive for the light, so the lamp may burn continually.

\ts\* 
\v 3 Outside the curtain of the testimony in the tent of meeting, Aaron must keep it in order, from evening until morning, before the face of Yahweh continually. It is a permanent statute throughout your generations. 
\v 4 On the pure gold lampstand he must keep the lamps in order before the face of Yahweh continually.

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And you must take fine flour and bake 12 cakes with it. There must be two-tenths of an ephah in one cake. 
\v 6 And you must set them in two rows, six in a row, on the pure gold table before the face of Yahweh.

\ts\* 
\v 7 And you must put on the row pure incense and it will be a memorial portion for the bread, an offering made by fire to Yahweh. 
\v 8 On the day of the sabbath, every sabbath, he must keep it in order before the face of Yahweh continually. It is from the sons of Israel as an eternal covenant. 
\v 9 And it will be for Aaron and for his sons, and they must eat it in a holy place. For it is a holiest holy thing for him, from Yahweh’s offerings made by fire, a perpetual portion.” 
\v 10 Now the son of an Israelite woman, who was also the son of an Egyptian man, went out in the midst of the sons of Israel. And the son of the Israelite woman and an Israelite man fought in the camp. 
\v 11 And the son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name and cursed, and they brought him to Moses. (Now his mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.) 
\v 12 And they caused him to remain in the guard-post until it would be made clear to them what was in accordance with the mouth of Yahweh.

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 14 “Bring out the one who has cursed to the outside of the camp. And all the hearers must lay their hands on his head, and all the assembly must stone him.

\ts\* 
\v 15 And speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘If any man curses his God, then he must bear his sin. 
\v 16 And he who blasphemes the name of Yahweh must surely be put to death. All the assembly must certainly stone him, as the sojouner so the native-born. When he blasphemes the Name, he must be put to death.

\ts\* 
\v 17 And if a man strikes dead any human being, he must certainly be put to death. 
\v 18 And he who strikes dead the life of an animal must repay it, life in place of life.

\ts\* 
\v 19 And if a man gives an injury to his fellow citizen, as he has done so it will be done to him: 
\v 20 fracture in place of fracture, eye in place of eye, tooth in place of tooth. As he gave an injury to a human, so it must be given to him. 
\v 21 And he who strikes dead an animal must repay it. And he who strikes dead a human must be put to death.

\ts\* 
\v 22 There must be one law for you, as the sojourner so will be the native-born. For I am Yahweh your God.’” 
\v 23 And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, and they brought the one who had cursed to the outside of the camp. And they stoned him with stones, and the sons of Israel did as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

\p
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying, 
\v 2 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you come to the land that I am giving to you, then the land must keep a sabbath, a sabbath for Yahweh.

\ts\* 
\v 3 Six years you must plant your field, and six years you must prune your vineyard and gather its produce. 
\v 4 And in the seventh year, there must be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath for Yahweh. You must not plant your field and you must not prune your vineyard.

\ts\* 
\v 5 You must not harvest the second growth of your harvest and you must not gather the grapes of your unpruned vines. It will be a year of solemn rest for the land. 
\v 6 And the sabbath of the land will be for you, as food for you, and for your male slave, and for your female slave, and for your hired servant, and for the foriegn resident who is sojourning with you, 
\v 7 and for your livestock and for the wild animal that is in your land, all its yield will be for eating.
\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And you must count for yourself seven sabbaths of years, seven times seven years, and there will be for you a period of seven sabbaths of years, 49 years. 
\v 9 And you must cause the horn blast to be heard on the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month. On the Day of Atonement you must cause the horn to be heard throughout all your land.

\ts\* 
\v 10 And you must set apart the year, year 50, and proclaim freedom in the land to all its inhabitants. It will be a jubilee for you and you must return a man to his property and you must return a man to his family.
\ts\* 
\v 11 That year, year 50, will be a jubilee for you. You must not plant and not harvest its second growth and not harvest its unpruned vines. 
\v 12 For it is a jubilee, it will be holy for you. You must eat its yield from the field.

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 In this Year of Jubilee you must return a man to his property. 
\v 14 And if you sell something sold to your fellow citizen or buy from the hand of your fellow citizen, a man must not oppress his brother.

\ts\* 
\v 15 According to the number of years after the jubilee you must buy from your fellow citizen. According to the number of years of yield he must sell to you. 
\v 16 According to the multitude of the years you must increase its purchase price, but according to the fewness of the years you must decrease its purchase price, because of the number of yields he is selling to you. 
\v 17 And you must not oppress, a man his fellow citizen. And you must fear your God, for I am Yahweh your God.

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And you must do my statutes, and my laws you must keep and do them. And you will dwell on the land securely. 
\v 19 And the land will give its fruit, and you will eat to satisfaction and dwell securely on it.

\ts\* 
\v 20 And if you say, “What will we eat in the seventh year? Look, we cannot plant and we cannot gather our yield.” 
\v 21 Then I will command my blessing for you in the sixth year, and it will produce yield for three years. 
\v 22 And you will plant in the eighth year and you will eat from the old yield until the ninth year, until its yield comes in you will eat the old. 
\v 23 And the land must not be sold for perpetuity, for the land belongs to me. For you are sojourners and temporary residents with me. 
\v 24 And in all the land of your possession you must give redemption for the land. 
\v 25 If your brother becomes poor and sells some of his property, then his redeemer nearest to him may come and redeem the things sold of his brother.

\ts\* 
\v 26 And if a man does not have a redeemer for it, but his hand produces and he finds enough for its redemption, 
\v 27 then he may calculate the years of its sale and return the balance to the man whom he sold it to. And he may return to his property. 
\v 28 And if his hand does not find enough to get it back for himself, then his sold things will remain in the hand of he who bought it until the Year of Jubilee. And it will go out in the Jubilee and he will return to his property.

\ts\*
\p
\v 29 And if a man sells a residential house of a walled city, then his right of redemption will be until the completion of the year of its sale. It will be the days of his right of redemption. 
\v 30 And if it is not redeemed for him up to the fulfilling of an entire year, then the house which is in the city which has its wall will belong in perpetuity to him who bought it and to his descendants. It will not go out in the Jubilee.

\ts\* 
\v 31 And the houses of the villages that have no wall around them will be considered as the field of the land. There will be redemption for it, and in the Jubilee it will go out. 
\v 32 As for the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, the right of redemption is permanent for the Levites.

\ts\* 
\v 33 And whatever is from the Levites he may redeem, and a sold house or a city of his posession will go out in the Jubilee. For the houses of the cities of the Levites—it is their possession among the sons of Israel. 
\v 34 And the field of the pastureland of their cities must not be sold because it is their permanent possession.

\ts\*
\p
\v 35 And if your brother becomes poor and his hand is shaky with you, then you must support him as a sojourner or temporary resident and he will live with you. 
\v 36 Do not take from him interest or usury, and you must fear your God and your brother may live with you. 
\v 37 Your silver you must not give to him with interest and for profit you must not give your food. 
\v 38 I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out from the land of Egypt to give to you the land of Canaan, to be your God.

\ts\*
\p
\v 39 And if your brother with you becomes poor and is sold to you, you must not make him work the work of a slave. 
\v 40 Like a hired worker, like a temporary resident, he must be with you. Until the Year of Jubilee he will serve with you. 
\v 41 And he will go away from you, he and his sons with him, and he will return to his clan. And he will return to the possession of his fathers.

\ts\* 
\v 42 For they are my servants, them which I brought out of the land of Egypt. They will not be sold in a slave sale. 
\v 43 You must not rule over him with ruthlessness, and you must fear your God. 
\v 44 As for your male slave and your female slave who you have for yourself, from the nations that surround you, from them you may acquire a male slave or a female slave.

\ts\* 
\v 45 And also from the sons of the sojourners who are dwelling with you, from them you may acquire, and from their clans who are with you, who have given birth in your land—they may become your property. 
\v 46 And you may bequeath them to your sons after you, to inherit as a possession, you may let them work permanently. But as for your brothers, the sons of Israel, a man with his brother, you must not rule over him with ruthlessness.

\ts\*
\p
\v 47 And if the hand of a sojourner or a temporary resident with you has produced, and your brother with you becomes poor and is sold to a sojourner, a temporary resident with you, or to a descendant of a clan of a sojourner, 
\v 48 after he has been sold, there will be redemption for him. One of his brothers may redeem him, 
\v 49 or his uncle, or the son of his uncle may redeem him; or a relative of his flesh from his clan may redeem him. Or, if his hand has produced, then he may redeem himself. 
\v 50 And he will calculate with his buyer from the year he was sold to him until the Year of Jubilee, and the silver of his sale must be according to the number of years; like the days of a hired worker it will be with him.

\ts\* 
\v 51 If there are still many of the years, according to them he must pay back his redemption from the silver of his purchase. 
\v 52 And if a few of the years until the Year of Jubilee are left, then he must calculate for him according to his years. He must pay back his redemption.

\ts\* 
\v 53 Like a hired worker year by year he will be with him. He must not rule over him with ruthlessness in your eyes. 
\v 54 And if he is not redeemed by these, then he must go out in the Year of Jubilee, he and his sons with him. 
\v 55 For to me the sons of Israel are servants. They are my servants, them which I brought out of the land of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.’”

\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 2 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘If a man vows a vow according to your valuation of persons to Yahweh,

\ts\* 
\v 3 then your valuation will be for a male from a son of 20 years and up to a son of 60 years and your valuation must be 50 shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the holy place. 
\v 4 And if she is a female, then your valuation must be 30 shekels.

\ts\* 
\v 5 And if from a son of five years and up to a son of 20 years, then your valuation for the male must be 20 shekels, and for the female ten shekels. 
\v 6 And if from a son of a month and up to a son of five years, then your valuation for the male must be five shekels of silver, and for the female your valuation of three shekels of silver.

\ts\* 
\v 7 And if from a son of 60 years and up, if a male, then your valuation must be 15 shekels, and for the female ten shekels. 
\v 8 And if he is poorer than your valuation, then he must present himself to the face of the priest, and the priest will value him. According to what the hand of the one making the vow produces the priest will value him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And if it is an animal from which they offer an offering to Yahweh, all that he gives from them to Yahweh will be set apart. 
\v 10 He must not replace it and he must not exchange it, a good one for a bad one or a bad for a good. And if he exchanges at all an animal for an animal, then it will be and the exchanged one will be set apart.

\ts\* 
\v 11 And if any animal is unclean from which an offering must not be offered to Yahweh, then he must present the animal to the face of the priest. 
\v 12 And the priest will set its value as either good or bad. According to the valuation of you, the priest, thus will it be.

\v 14 And when a man sets apart his house as a holy thing to Yahweh, then the priest will set its value as either good or bad. As the priest values it, so it will stand.

\v 16 And if a man sets apart part of the field of his property to Yahweh, then your valuation will be in proportion to its seed—a homer of barley seed for 50 shekels of silver.

\ts\* 
\v 17 If he sets apart his field during the Year of Jubilee, according to your valuation it will stand. 
\v 18 And if he sets apart his field after the Jubilee, then the priest must calculate for it the silver according to the years remaining until the Year of Jubilee, and it must be reduced from your valuation.

\ts\* 
\v 19 And if he who set it apart ever redeems the field, then he must add a fifth of the silver of your valuation to it, and it will belong to him. 
\v 20 And if he does not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it cannot be redeemed again. 
\v 21 And the field will be, when it goes out in the Jubilee, a holy thing to Yahweh, like the field that has been dedicated by ban. It will belong to the priest as his property.

\ts\* 
\v 22 And if he sets apart to Yahweh a field of his acquisition that is not part of the field of his property,

\v 26 Surely the firstborn which belongs as firstborn to Yahweh among animals, a man must not set it apart. Whether ox or sheep, it belongs to Yahweh.

\ts\*
\p
\v 28 Surely any dedicated thing that a man dedicates to Yahweh, from all that belongs to him, from human or animal, or from the field of his property, must not be sold and must not be redeemed. Every dedicated thing, it is the holiest holy thing to Yahweh.

\ts\* 
\v 32 As for every tenth of the herd or the flock, anything that passes under the rod, the tenth must be set apart to Yahweh.
