\v 1 Now it happened after the death of Moses the servant of Yahweh, that Yahweh spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, the assistant of Moses, saying,
\v 2 “Moses, my servant, is dead. So now, rise, cross over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land that I am giving to them, to the sons of Israel.
\v 3 Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon, I have given it to you, just as I spoke to Moses.

\ts\*
\v 4 From the wilderness and this Lebanon and as far as the great river, the Euphrates River, all the land of the Hittites, and as far as the great sea, the going of the sun, will be your territory.
\v 5 No man will {be able to} stand against your face all the days of your life. I will be with you just as I was with Moses. I will not abandon you and I will not leave you.

\ts\*
\v 6 Be strong and be courageous, for you yourself will cause this people to inherit the land that I swore to their fathers to give to them.
\v 7 Only be strong and be very courageous, to be careful to do according to all the law that Moses, my servant, commanded you. Do not turn aside from it to the right or to the left, so that you may succeed in every place where you go.

\ts\*
\v 8 This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you will be careful to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your ways prosperous and then you will succeed.
\v 9 Have I not commanded you? Be strong and be courageous! Do not be terrified and do not be dismayed, for Yahweh your God {is} with you in every {place} where you go.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 10 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
\v 11 “Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people, saying, ‘Prepare provisions for yourselves because within three days you will be about to cross over this Jordan to enter to possess the land that Yahweh your God is about to give to you to possess it.’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites and to the half of the tribe of Manasseh, Joshua spoke, saying,
\v 13 “Remember the word that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you, saying, ‘Yahweh your God is about to give rest to you and he will give to you this land.’

\ts\*
\v 14 Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock may remain in the land that Moses gave to you on the east side of the Jordan. But you, you shall cross over before the face of your brothers being armed {for battle}, all the mighty men of valor, and shall help them
\v 15 until when Yahweh gives rest to your brothers as you, and they, they also, possess the land that Yahweh your God is about to give to them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession and shall possess it, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave to you on the other side of the Jordan, the rising place of the sun.”

\ts\*
\v 16 And they answered Joshua, saying, “All that you have commanded us we will do, and to every place where you will send us we will go.
\v 17 As in everything that we listened to Moses so we will listen to you. Only may Yahweh your God be with you, just as he was with Moses.
\v 18 Every man who rebels against your mouth and will not hear your words according to all that you command him shall be put to death. Only be strong and be courageous.”

\p
\v 1 And Joshua the son of Nun secretly sent from Shittim two men, spies, saying, “Go, see the land and Jericho.” And they went and entered the house of a woman, a prostitute, and her name was Rahab, and they lay down there.
\v 2 And it was said to the king of Jericho, saying, “Behold, men have come here tonight from the sons of Israel to search out the land.”
\v 3 Then the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, “Bring out the men, the ones coming to you, who came to your house, because they have come to search out all of the land.”

\ts\*
\v 4 And the woman had taken the two men and had hidden them. And she said, “Indeed, the men came to me and I did not know from where they {were from}.
\v 5 And the gate was shut at the darkness, then the men went out. I do not know to where the men went. Pursue after them quickly for you may overtake them.”

\ts\*
\v 6 (Now she had brought them up to the roof and had hidden them in the stalks of flax she had arranged on the roof.)
\v 7 And the men pursued after them on the road to the Jordan to the fords. And they shut the gate after when the pursuers had gone out after them.

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 Now before they lay down {to sleep} she went up to them on the roof.
\v 9 And she said to the men, “I know that Yahweh has given to you the land and that the dread of you has fallen on us and that all who dwell in the land have melted from your face.

\ts\*
\v 10 For we have heard that Yahweh dried up the water of the Sea of Reeds from before your face when you went out from Egypt, and what you did to two of the kings of the Amorite who {were} on the other side of the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, them whom you completely destroyed.
\v 11 And we have heard {these things} and our hearts have melted and the spirit in a man no longer stands before your face. For Yahweh your God, he is God in the heavens above and on the earth below.

\ts\*
\v 12 And now, please swear to me by Yahweh because I have shown kindness with you, that you also will show kindness with the house of my father and give to me a sign of truth,
\v 13 that you will keep alive my father and my mother and my brothers and my sisters and all who {belong} to them. And you will deliver our lives from death.”

\ts\*
\v 14 And the men said to her, “Our lives in place of yours to die! If you do not tell this matter of ours, then it will happen when Yahweh gives to us the land that we will do kindness and faithfulness with you.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 Then she lowered them down by a rope through the window because her house {was} in the surface of the city wall, and she was dwelling in the city wall.
\v 16 And she said to them, “Go to the hill country lest the ones pursuing meet you. And hide there three days until the ones pursuing have returned. And after you may go your way.”
\v 17 And the men said to her, “We {will be} innocent from this oath of yours which you have made us swear:

\ts\*
\v 18 Behold, we are about to come into the land! You shall tie this cord of thread of the scarlet material in the window which you lowered us down through, and your father and your mother and your brothers and all the house of your father you shall gather to you at the house.
\v 19 And it will be that anyone who goes out from the doors of your house to the outside, his blood {will be} on his head and we {will be} innocent. But anyone who is with you in the house, his blood {will be} on our heads if a hand is laid on him.

\ts\*
\v 20 But if you tell this matter of ours, then we will be innocent from your oath which you made us swear.”
\v 21 And she said, “According to your words, so {be} it.” And she sent them away and they went. And she tied the cord of red material in the window.
\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And they departed and came to the hill country and they stayed there three days until the pursuers had returned. And the ones pursuing searched along all the road but did not find them.
\v 23 And the two men returned and descended from the hill country and crossed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun. And they told him all the things happening to them.
\v 24 And they said to Joshua, “Truly Yahweh has given all the land into our hand. And also all those inhabiting the land are melting from before our face.”

\p
\v 1 And Joshua rose early in the morning and they set out from the Shittim. And they came as far as the Jordan, he and all the sons of Israel, and they stayed overnight there before they crossed over.
\v 2 And it happened at the end of three days, that the officers passed through the midst of the camp.
\v 3 And they commanded the people, saying, “As soon as you see the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh your God and the priests, the Levites, lifting it, then you yourselves shall set out from your place and shall go after it—
\v 4 but a distance shall be between you and it of about 2, 000 cubits in measurement; do not come near to it—so that you will know the way in which you should go, since you have not passed over by the way from yesterday or the day before.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And Joshua said to the people, “Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow Yahweh will do wonders in your midst.”
\v 6 And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, “Lift up the Box of the Covenant and cross over before the face of the people.” And they lifted up the Box of the Covenant and went before the face of the people.

\ts\*
\p
\v 7 And Yahweh said to Joshua, “This day I will begin to make you great in the eyes of all Israel who will know that just as I was with Moses, I am with you.
\v 8 And as for you, you shall command the priests who lift the Box of the Covenant, saying, ‘As soon as you come as far as the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand in the Jordan.’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And Joshua said to the sons of Israel, “Come near to here and hear the words of Yahweh your God.”
\v 10 And Joshua said, “By this you will know that the living God is in your midst and {that} he will surely dispossess from your face the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Hivite and the Perizzite and the Girgashite and the Amorite and the Jebusite.
\v 11 Behold, the Box of the Covenant of the Lord of all the earth is about to cross over before your face in the Jordan.

\ts\*
\v 12 And now, take for yourselves 12 men from the tribes of Israel, one man, one man for each tribe.
\v 13 And it will happen as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests who lift the Box of Yahweh, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan will be cut off, the waters going down from above. And they will stand as one heap.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And it happened when the people set out from their tents to cross over the Jordan, that the priests lifting the Box of the Covenant were before the face of the people.
\v 15 And as soon as those lifting the Box came as far as the Jordan then the feet of the priests lifting the Box were dipped in the edge of the water. (Now the Jordan was full over all its banks all the days of the harvest.)
\v 16 Then the waters going down from above stood {still}. They rose up as one heap at a great distance away, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, and those going down to the sea of the Arabah, the Sea of Salt, were completely cut off. (Now the people crossed over opposite Jericho.)
\v 17 So the priests lifting the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh stood firmly on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan. And all Israel was crossing over on dry ground until when all the nation had finished crossing over the Jordan.

\ts\*


\c 4
\p
\v 1 And it happened just as all the nation finished crossing over the Jordan that Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,
\v 2 “Take 12 men for yourselves from the people, one man, one man from a tribe.
\v 3 And command them saying: ‘Lift up for yourselves 12 stones from here, from the midst of the Jordan, from the firm standing place of the feet of the priests. And you shall bring them over with you and you shall leave them in the lodging place in which you will lodge tonight.’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 And Joshua called to the 12 men whom he had appointed from the sons of Israel, one man, one man from a tribe.
\v 5 And Joshua said to them, “Cross over before the face of the Box of Yahweh your God into the midst of the Jordan. And lift up for yourselves, one stone a man upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel,

\ts\*
\v 6 so that this will be a sign in your midst. When your sons ask in the future, saying, ‘What are these stones to you?’
\v 7 Then you will say to them, ‘Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off from the face of the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh, when it crossed over in the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off.’ And these stones will be for a memorial for the sons of Israel until eternity.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And the sons of Israel did so, just as Joshua commanded. And they lifted up 12 stones from the midst of the Jordan, just as Yahweh said to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel. And they brought them over with them to the lodging place and they left them there.
\v 9 And Joshua set up 12 stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place of the standing place of the feet of the priests who carried the Box of the Covenant. And they are there until this day.

\ts\*
\v 10 And the priests who carried the Box stood in the midst of the Jordan until every thing that Yahweh commanded Joshua to speak to the people was finished, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua. And the people hurried and crossed over.
\v 11 And it happened just as all the people had finished crossing over, that the Box of Yahweh with the priests crossed over before the face of the people.

\ts\*
\v 12 And the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh, armed men, crossed over before the face of the sons of Israel, just as Moses had spoken to them.
\v 13 About 40, 000 men equipped for war of the army crossed over before the face of Yahweh to the plains of Jericho for battle.

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 On that day Yahweh made Joshua great in the eyes of all Israel. And they feared him just as they had feared Moses all the days of his life.

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 And Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,
\v 16 “Command the priests who carry the Box of the Testimony and they shall come up from the Jordan.”

\ts\*
\v 17 And Joshua commanded the priests, saying, “Come up from the Jordan.”
\v 18 And it happened that when the priests carrying the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh came up from the midst of the Jordan, the soles of the feet of the priests were raised out to dry ground, then the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and went over all its banks, as yesterday and three days ago.
\ts\*
\p
\v 19 Now the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth {day} of the first month. And they camped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho.
\v 20 And Joshua set up in the Gilgal those 12 stones which they had taken from the Jordan.
\v 21 And he spoke to the sons of Israel, saying, “When your sons ask their fathers in the future, saying, ‘What are these stones?’

\ts\*
\v 22 then you shall cause your sons to know, saying, ‘Israel crossed over this Jordan on dry ground.’
\v 23 For Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from your face until you crossed over, just as Yahweh your God did to the Sea of Reeds, which he dried up before us until we crossed over,
\v 24 so that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of Yahweh, that it is mighty, so that you will fear Yahweh your God all the days.”


\ts\*


\c 5
\p
\v 1 And it happened that when all the kings of the Amorite who were on the other side of the Jordan toward the sea, and all the kings of the Canaanite who were beside the sea, heard that Yahweh had dried up the waters of the Jordan from the face of the sons of Israel until they had crossed over, then their heart melted, and there was no longer a spirit in them from the face of the sons of Israel.\f + \fq until they had crossed over \ft or perhaps \fqa until we had crossed over \ft (Hebrew Ketiv).\f*

\ts\*
\p
\v 2 At that time Yahweh said to Joshua, “Make for yourself knives of flint and again, circumcise the sons of Israel a second time.”
\v 3 So Joshua made for himself knives of flint. And he circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.

\ts\*
\v 4 And this is the reason that Joshua circumcised {them}: All the people who had gone out from Egypt, the males, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness on the way, when they had gone out from Egypt.
\v 5 For all the people who went out were circumcised, but all the people who were born in the wilderness on the way as they went out from Egypt had not been circumcised.

\ts\*
\v 6 For the sons of Israel had walked in the wilderness 40 years, until the finishing of all the nation of the men of war who had gone out from Egypt, because they had not listened to the voice of Yahweh, to whom Yahweh had sworn to not let them see the land that Yahweh had sworn to their fathers to give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
\v 7 And he raised up their sons instead of them, them Joshua circumcised. For they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them on the way.

\ts\*
\v 8 And it happened just as all the nation had finished being circumcised, that they stayed in their places in the camp until their recovering.
\v 9 And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the disgrace of Egypt from on you.” And so the name of that place is called Gilgal until this day.

\ts\*
\p
\v 10 And the sons of Israel camped at the Gilgal and they performed the Passover on day 14 of the month, in the evening, on the plains of Jericho.
\v 11 And they ate from the produce of the land, from the next day of the Passover, unleavened cakes and roasted grain, on this same day.
\v 12 And the manna stopped from the day after when they ate from the yield of the land, and there was no longer manna for the sons of Israel. And they ate from the produce of the land of Canaan in that year.

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And it happened when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man was standing in front of him and his drawn sword was in his hand. And Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you for us or for our enemies?”
\v 14 And he said, “No, but I, {as} the leader of the army of Yahweh, I have now come.” And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and bowed down. And he said to him, “What is my lord going to speak to his servant?”
\v 15 And the leader of the army of Yahweh said to Joshua, “Slip off your sandal from on your foot, because the place on which you are standing, it is holy.” And Joshua did so.


\ts\*


\c 6
\p
\v 1 Now Jericho was shutting and was shut up from the face of the sons of Israel. There was no going out and there was no coming in.
\v 2 And Yahweh said to Joshua, “See, I have given Jericho into your hand, and its king, the mighty men of valor.

\ts\*
\v 3 And you shall go around the city, all the men of war, going around the city one time. Thus you shall do six days.

\ts\*
\v 4 And seven priests shall carry seven horns of rams before the face of the Box. And on the seventh day you shall go around the city seven times and the priests shall blow with the horns.
\v 5 And it will happen that when sounding a blast with the horn of the ram, as soon as you hear the sound of the horn, all the people shall shout a great shout. And the wall of the city will fall under itself and the people will go up, a man in front of him.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 And Joshua the son of Nun called to the priests and said to them, “Lift the Box of the Covenant, and seven priests shall carry seven horns of rams before the face of the Box of Yahweh.”
\v 7 And he said to the people, “Pass over and go around the city, and the men equipped for war will pass over before the face of the Box of Yahweh.”

\ts\*
\v 8 And it happened that, as soon as Joshua had spoken to the people, that the seven priests carrying seven horns of rams before the face of Yahweh passed over and blew with the horns. And the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh was going behind them.
\v 9 And the men equipped for war were walking before the face of the priests, blowing the horns. And the rear guard were walking behind the Box, walking and blowing with the horns.

\ts\*
\v 10 And Joshua commanded the people, saying, “You shall not shout and you shall not make your voice heard, and a word shall not go out from your mouth until the day I say to you, ‘Shout!’ Then you shall shout.”
\v 11 And he brought the Box of Yahweh around the city, circling one time. And they entered the camp and they stayed the night in the camp.

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 And Joshua got up early in the morning. And the priests lifted up the Box of Yahweh.
\v 13 And the seven priests who were carrying the seven horns of rams before the face of the Box of Yahweh were walking continually and blowing with the horns. And the men equipped for war were walking before their face, and the rear guard was walking behind the Box of Yahweh, continually blowing with the horns.
\v 14 And they went around the city one time on the second day and returned to the camp. Thus they did six days.

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 And it happened on the seventh day that they got up early as soon as the dawn had risen, and they went around the city according to this manner seven times. Only on that day they went around the city seven times.
\v 16 And it happened that on the seventh time, the priests blew with the horns. And Joshua said to the people, “Shout, for Yahweh has given to you the city!

\ts\*
\v 17 And the city, it and all that is in it, is a banned thing for Yahweh. Only Rahab the prostitute will live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers whom we sent.
\v 18 But only you, keep from the banned thing, lest you put under the ban and take from the banned thing and make the camp of Israel into a banned thing and trouble it.
\v 19 And all the silver and gold and objects of bronze and iron, it is a holy thing for Yahweh. It shall enter the storehouse of Yahweh.”

\ts\*
\v 20 And the people shouted and they blew with the horns. And it happened as soon as the people heard the sound of the horn, that the people shouted with a great shout. And the wall fell under itself, and the people went up to the city, a man straight in front of him, and they captured the city.
\v 21 And they completely destroyed all that was in the city by the mouth of the sword, from man and as far as woman, from young and as far as old, and as far as ox and sheep and donkey.

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, “Enter the house of the woman, the prostitute, and bring out from there the woman and all who belong to her, just as you swore to her.”
\v 23 And the young men, the ones who had spied, entered and brought out Rahab and her father and her mother and her brothers and all who belonged to her. And they brought out all her relatives and rested them outside the camp of Israel.

\ts\*
\v 24 And they burned with fire the city and all that was in it. Only the silver and the gold and the objects of bronze and iron they gave to the storehouse of the house of Yahweh.
\v 25 And Joshua kept alive Rahab the prostitute and the house of her father and all who belonged to her. And she has dwelt in the midst of Israel to this day because she hid the messengers whom Joshua had sent to spy on Jericho.

\ts\*
\p
\v 26 And Joshua made them take an oath at that time, saying, “Cursed is the man before the face of Yahweh who rises up and builds this city, Jericho. With his firstborn he will found it and with his youngest he will set up its doors.”
\v 27 And Yahweh was with Joshua. And the report of him was in all the land.

\ts\*


\c 7
\p
\v 1 And the sons of Israel were unfaithful in unfaithfulness with the banned thing. And Achan the son of Karmi the son of Zabdi the son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, took from the banned thing. And the nose of Yahweh burned against the sons of Israel.

\ts\*
\p
\v 2 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to the Ai, which was near Beth Aven, from the east of Bethel. And he spoke to them, saying, “Go up and spy out the land.” And the men went up and spied out the Ai.
\v 3 And they returned to Joshua and said to him, “Do not let all the people go up. About 2, 000 men or about 3, 000 men should go up and strike the Ai. Do not cause all the people to be weary there because they are few.”

\ts\*
\v 4 And some from the people went up to there, about 3, 000 men, and they fled before the face of the men of the Ai.
\v 5 And the men of the Ai struck down from them about 36 men and they pursued them before the face of the gate as far as the Shebarim. And they struck them down on the slope. And the heart of the people melted and became water.

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 And Joshua tore his garments and fell on his face to the earth before the face of the Box of Yahweh until the evening, he and the elders of Israel. And they caused dust to go up on their heads.
\v 7 And Joshua said, “Ah, my Lord Yahweh! Why at all did you bring this people across the Jordan to give us into the hand of the Amorite, to cause us to perish? And if only we had been content and had stayed on the other side of the Jordan!

\ts\*
\v 8 Please, my Lord! What can I say, after Israel has turned the back of the neck before the face of its enemies?
\v 9 And the Canaanite and all those who dwell in the land will hear and will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. And what will you do for your great name?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 10 And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Get yourself up! Why is this—you are falling on your face?
\v 11 Israel has sinned and also passed over my covenant, which I commanded them, and also taken from the banned thing and also stolen and also deceived and also placed among their things.
\v 12 And the sons of Israel were not able to stand before the face of their enemies. They turned the back of the neck before the face of their enemies because they have become a banned thing. I will not be with you again if you do not destroy the banned thing from your midst.

\ts\*
\v 13 Get up! Consecrate the people and you shall say, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, because thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, “A banned thing is in your midst, Israel. You will not be able to stand before the face of your enemies until you remove the banned thing from your midst.”
\v 14 And you shall be brought near in the morning by your tribes. And it will happen that the tribe that Yahweh catches shall come near by the clans. And the clan that Yahweh catches shall come near by the houses. And the house that Yahweh catches shall come near by the men.
\v 15 And it will happen that the one who is caught with the banned thing shall be burned with the fire, he and all that belongs to him, because he has crossed over the covenant of Yahweh, and because he has done a disgraceful thing in Israel.’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 16 And Joshua got up early in the morning and brought Israel near by its tribes. And the tribe of Judah was caught.
\v 17 And he brought near the clans of Judah and the clan of the Zerahite was caught. And he brought near the clan of the Zerahite by the men and Zabdi was caught.
\v 18 And he brought near his house by the men and Achan the son of Karmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, was caught.

\ts\*
\v 19 And Joshua said to Achan, “My son, now give glory to Yahweh the God of Israel and give thanks to him. And tell me now what you have done. Do not hide it from me.”
\v 20 And Achan answered Joshua and said, “Truly, I have sinned against Yahweh the God of Israel. And like this and like this I did:
\v 21 And I saw among the spoil one good coat of Shinar and 200 shekels silver and one tongue-shaped piece of gold (50 shekels was its weight). And I desired them and took them. And behold, they are hidden in the earth in the midst of my tent and the silver is under it.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And Joshua sent messengers and they ran to the tent. And behold, it was hidden in his tent and the silver was under it.
\v 23 And they took them from the midst of the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the sons of Israel. And they poured them out before the face of Yahweh.

\ts\*
\v 24 And Joshua took Achan the son of Zerah and the silver and the coat and the tongue-shaped piece of gold and his sons and his daughters and his ox and his donkey and his sheep and his tent and all that was for him, and all Israel with him. And they brought them to the Valley of Trouble.
\v 25 And Joshua said, “Why have you troubled us? Yahweh will trouble you on this day.” And all Israel stoned him with stone. And they burned them with the fire and they stoned them with the stones.
\v 26 And they raised up over him a great pile of stones until this day. And Yahweh turned from the burning of his nose. Therefore the name of that place is called the Valley of Trouble until this day.

\c 8
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Do not fear and do not be dismayed. Take with you all the people of war and rise, go up to the Ai. See, I have given into your hand the king of the Ai and his people and his city and his land.
\v 2 And you shall do to the Ai and its king just as you have done to Jericho and its king, except you will plunder its spoil and its livestock for yourselves. Set for yourselves an ambush against the city from behind it.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 3 And Joshua and all the people of war rose to go up to the Ai. And Joshua chose 30, 000 men, mighty ones of the army, and sent them at night.
\v 4 And he commanded them, saying, “See, you lie in ambush against the city from behind the city. You shall not be very far from the city. And all of you shall be ready.

\ts\*
\v 5 As for me and all the people who are with me, we will come near to the city. And it will happen when they come out to meet us just as at the first, that we will flee before their face.
\v 6 And they will come out after us until we have drawn them from the city. For they will say, ‘They are fleeing before our face just as at the first.’ And we will flee before their face.

\ts\*
\v 7 And you will rise from ambush and take possession of the city. And Yahweh your God will give it into your hand.
\v 8 And it will happen that when you capture the city, you will kindle the city with fire. You will do according to the word of Yahweh. See, I have commanded you.”
\v 9 And Joshua sent them and they went to the ambush place and they stayed between Bethel and the Ai from west of the Ai. And Joshua stayed overnight that night in the midst of the people.

\v 10 And Joshua got up early in the morning and mustered the people. And he and the elders of Israel went up before the face of the people to the Ai.
\v 11 And all the people of war who were with him went up and approached and came before the city. And they camped from north of the Ai and the valley was between them and the Ai.
\v 12 And he took about 5, 000 men. And he set them in ambush between Bethel and the Ai, from west of the city.

\ts\*
\v 13 And the people set all the camp that was from north of the city and its rear guard from west of the city. And Joshua went in that night into the midst of the valley.
\v 14 And it happened that as soon as the king of the Ai saw, then the men of the city hurried and got up early and went out to meet Israel for the battle, he and all his people, at an appointed place before the face of the Arabah. Now he did not know that an ambush was against him from behind the city.

\ts\*
\v 15 And Joshua and all Israel let themselves be struck before the face of them. And they fled the way of the wilderness.
\v 16 And all the people who were in the city were summoned to pursue after them. And they pursued after Joshua and were drawn away from the city.
\v 17 And there was not a man left in the Ai or Bethel who had not pursued after Israel. And they left the city open and they pursued after Israel.

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Stretch out with the javelin that is in your hand toward the Ai, because I will give it into your hand.” And Joshua stretched out with the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.
\v 19 And the ambush rose quickly from its place and they ran when he stretched out his hand. And they entered the city and captured it and hurried and kindled the city with fire.

\ts\*
\v 20 And the men of the Ai turned behind them and looked, and behold, the smoke of the city went up to the heavens! And it was not in their hands to flee here or there. And the people who had fled to the wilderness turned around toward the pursuers.
\v 21 And Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had captured the city, and that the smoke of the city went up. And they turned back and struck down the men of the Ai.

\ts\*
\v 22 And these came out from the city to meet them and they were in the midst of Israel, these from here and these from there. And they struck them down until he left no survivor or refugee of them.
\v 23 And they seized the king of the Ai alive. And they brought him near to Joshua.

\ts\*
\p
\v 24 And it happened when Israel had finished slaying all those who dwelled in the Ai in the field in the wilderness in which they pursued them, and all of them had fallen by the mouth of the sword until they were finished, that all Israel returned to the Ai and struck it with the mouth of the sword.
\v 25 And it happened that all the ones who fell on that day, from man and as far as woman, were 12, 000, all the men of the Ai.
\v 26 And Joshua did not turn back his hand which he had stretched out with the javelin, until when he had completely destroyed all those who dwelled in the Ai.

\ts\*
\v 27 Israel plundered for themselves only the livestock and the spoil of that city, according to the word of Yahweh which he had commanded Joshua.
\v 28 And Joshua burned the Ai. And he made it a mound of eternity, a desolation until this day.
\v 29 And he hanged the king of the Ai on a tree until the time of the evening. And when the sun was going, Joshua commanded and they brought down his corpse from the tree and threw it at the opening of the gate of the city and raised over it a great pile of stones until this day.

\ts\*
\p
\v 30 Then Joshua built an altar to Yahweh the God of Israel on Mount Ebal.
\v 31 It was just as Moses the servant of Yahweh had commanded the sons of Israel, as written in the book of the law of Moses: “An altar of whole stones, over which no one has wielded an iron tool.” And they offered up on it burnt up offerings to Yahweh and sacrificed peace offerings.

\ts\*
\v 32 And there on the stones he wrote a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote before the face of the sons of Israel.
\v 33 And all Israel and its elders and officers and its judges were standing from here and from there at the Box in front of the priests and the Levites who carried the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh, like the foreigner so the native, half of them toward the front of Mount Gerizim and half of them toward the front of Mount Ebal. It was just as Moses the servant of Yahweh had commanded to bless the people of Israel at the first.

\ts\*
\v 34 And afterward, he read all the words of the law, the blessings and the curses, according to all that is written in the book of the law.
\v 35 There was not a word from all that Moses had commanded that Joshua did not read in front of all the assembly of Israel and the women and the children and the sojourners who are going in the midst of them.

\v 1 And it happened that as soon as all the kings heard it who were on the other side of the Jordan, in the hill country, and in the lowlands and in all the coast of the great sea toward the front of the Lebanon (the Hittite and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite),
\v 2 then they gathered themselves together as one mouth to fight against Joshua and against Israel.

\ts\*
\p
\v 3 And those who dwelled in Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to the Ai.
\v 4 And they, even they, acted with cunning. And they went and acted as envoys and took worn-out sacks for their donkeys and worn-out and torn and mended skins of wine.\f + \ft Instead of \fq acted as envoys, \ft some versions have, \fqa took provisions.\f*
\v 5 And worn-out and patched sandals were on their feet, and worn-out garments were on them, and all the bread of their provisions was dry and had become crumbs.
\ts\*
\v 6 And they went to Joshua in the camp at the Gilgal. And they said to him and to a man of Israel, “We have come from a distant land, and now cut a covenant for us.”
\v 7 And they said, a man of Israel, to the Hivite, “Perhaps you are dwelling among us. And how can I cut a covenant for you?”
\v 8 And they said to Joshua, “We are your servants.” And Joshua said to them, “Who are you? And where did you come from?”

\ts\*
\v 9 And they said to him, “Your servants have come from a very distant land for the name of Yahweh your God. For we have heard a report of him and all that he did in Egypt,
\v 10 and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorite who were on the other side of the Jordan, to Sihon the king of Heshbon, and to Og the king of the Bashan who was in Ashtaroth.

\ts\*
\v 11 And our elders and all those who dwell in our land spoke to us, saying, ‘Take provisions in your hand for the road and go to meet them. And you shall say to them, “We are your servants. And now cut a covenant for us.”’
\v 12 This bread of ours was hot, we took it as our provision from our houses on the day of our going out to come to you. And now, behold, it is dry and has become crumbs.
\v 13 And these skins of wine that we filled were new, and behold, they are torn. And these, our garments and our sandals, are worn-out from the very great length of the road.”

\ts\*
\v 14 And the men took from their provisions. But they did not ask the mouth of Yahweh.
\v 15 And Joshua made peace for them, and cut a covenant for them to let them live. And the leaders of the congregation swore to them.

\ts\*
\p
\v 16 And it happened from the end of three days after when they had cut a covenant for them, that they heard that they were near to them and they were dwelling among them.
\v 17 And the sons of Israel set out and came to their cities on the third day. And their cities were Gibeon and Kephirah and Beeroth and Kiriath Jearim.

\ts\*
\v 18 And the sons of Israel did not strike them down because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh the God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the leaders.
\v 19 And all the leaders said to all the congregation, “We ourselves have sworn to them by Yahweh the God of Israel. And now we are not able to touch them.

\ts\*
\v 20 We will do this to them and let them live. And wrath will not be on us on account of the oath which we swore to them.”
\v 21 And the leaders said to them, “Let them live.” And they became cutters of trees and drawers of water for all the congregation, just as the leaders had spoken to them.

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And Joshua called to them and spoke to them, saying, “Why did you deceive us, saying, ‘We are very far from you,’ but you are dwelling among us?
\v 23 And now you are cursed. And a slave will not be cut off from you, and cutters of trees and drawers of water for the house of my God.”

\ts\*
\v 24 And they answered Joshua and said, “Because it was clearly told to your servants that Yahweh your God commanded his servant Moses to give to you all the land and to destroy all those who dwell in the land from before your face. And we were very afraid for our lives because of your face, so we did this thing.
\v 25 And now, behold, we are in your hand. Do to us as is good and as is right in your eyes to do.”

\ts\*
\v 26 And he did thus to them. And he rescued them from the hand of the sons of Israel and they did not slay them.
\v 27 And on that day Joshua made them cutters of trees and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of Yahweh, until this day, in the place that he would choose.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 And it happened that as soon as Adoni-Zedek the king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured the Ai and had completely destroyed it (just as he had done to Jericho and to its king, so he had done to the Ai and to its king), and that those who dwelled in Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them,
\v 2 then they were very afraid because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the cities of the kingdom, and because it was greater than the Ai, and all its men were mighty ones.

\ts\*
\v 3 And Adoni-Zedek the king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham the king of Hebron and to Piram the king of Jarmuth and to Japhia the king of Lachish and to Debir the king of Eglon, saying,
\v 4 “Come up to me and help me. And let us strike Gibeon. For it has made peace with Joshua and with the sons of Israel.”

\ts\*
\v 5 And the five kings of the Amorites gathered and went up: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon—they and all their camps. And they camped against Gibeon and fought against it.

\ts\*
\v 6 And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua, to the camp at the Gilgal, saying, “Do not let your hand drop from your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us and help us because all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the hill country have gathered against us.”
\v 7 And Joshua went up from the Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him and all the mighty ones of the army.

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid from them, for they are given into your hand. Not a man from them will stand before you.”
\v 9 And Joshua came to them suddenly, all the night he went up from the Gilgal.

\ts\*
\v 10 And Yahweh confused them before the face of Israel and struck them down with a great blow in Gibeon. And he pursued them on the road going up to Beth Horon and he struck them down as far as Azekah and as far as Makkedah.
\v 11 And it happened when they fled from the face of Israel, they were on the slope of Beth Horon, that Yahweh threw large stones on them from the heavens as far as Azekah and they died. There were more who died by the stones of hail than the sons of Israel slew with the sword.
\ts\*
\p
\v 12 Then Joshua spoke to Yahweh on the day Yahweh gave the Amorites before the face of the sons of Israel. And he said before the eyes of Israel,
\q “Sun, be still in Gibeon,
\q and moon, in the Valley of Aijalon.”
\q
\v 13 And the sun was still and the moon stood
\q until the nation took vengeance on its enemies.
\p
Is it not written in the Book of the Upright?
\q “And the sun stood in the middle of the heavens,
\q and it did not hurry to go for about a whole day.”\f + \fq the Book of the Upright \ft or perhaps \fqa the Book of Jashar\f*
\v 14 And there has been no day like this before the face of it or after it, when Yahweh listened to the voice of a man. For Yahweh fought for Israel.
\v 15 And Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at the Gilgal.
\ts\*
\p
\v 16 And these five kings had fled and hidden themselves in the cave in Makkedah.
\v 17 And it was told to Joshua, saying, “The five kings have been found hidden in the cave in Makkedah.”

\ts\*
\v 18 And Joshua said, “Roll large stones to the mouth of the cave and assign men beside it to guard them.
\v 19 But you, do not stay! Chase after your enemies and strike their rear. Do not allow them to enter into their cities for Yahweh your God has given them into your hand.”

\ts\*
\v 20 And it happened as soon as Joshua and the sons of Israel finished striking them down with a very great blow until they had finished, that the escapees escaped from them and entered into the cities of fortification.
\v 21 And all the people returned in peace to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah. No man sharpened his tongue against the sons of Israel.

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave. And bring out to me these five kings from the cave.”
\v 23 And they did so and brought out to him these five kings from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.

\ts\*
\v 24 And it happened as soon as they brought out these kings to Joshua, that Joshua called to every man of Israel and said to the commanders of the men of war, the ones who had gone with him, “Come near. Set your feet on the necks of these kings.” So they came near and set their feet on their necks.
\v 25 And Joshua said to them, “Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed. Be strong and be courageous, for thus Yahweh will do to all your enemies, they whom you are about to fight.”

\ts\*
\v 26 And Joshua struck them down afterward and he put them to death and hanged them on five trees. And they were hanging on the trees until the evening.
\v 27 And it happened that at the time of the going of the sun Joshua commanded and they brought them down from on the trees and threw them into the cave there where they were hidden. And they set large stones over the mouth of the cave until this same day.

\ts\*
\p
\v 28 And Joshua captured Makkedah on that day. And he struck down it and its king by the mouth of the sword. He completely destroyed them and all the life that was in it; he did not leave a survivor. And he did to the king of Makkedah just as he had done to the king of Jericho.

\ts\*
\p
\v 29 And Joshua and all Israel with him passed over from Makkedah to Libnah. And he fought against Libnah.
\v 30 And Yahweh also gave it and its king into the hand of Israel, and he struck it down with the mouth of the sword and all the life that was in it; he did not leave a survivor in it. And he did to its king just as he had done to the king of Jericho.

\ts\*
\p
\v 31 And Joshua and all Israel with him passed over from Libnah to Lachish. And he camped against it and fought against it.
\v 32 And Yahweh gave Lachish into the hand of Israel and he captured it on the second day. And he struck it down by the mouth of the sword and all the life that was in it like all that he had done to Libnah.

\ts\*
\p
\v 33 Then Horam the king of Gezer went up to help Lachish. And Joshua struck him and his people down until he left no survivor for him.
\v 34 And Joshua and all Israel with him passed over from Lachish to Eglon. And they camped against it and fought against it.
\v 35 And they captured it on that day and struck it down by the mouth of the sword. And he completely destroyed all the life that was in it on that day like all that he had done to Lachish.

\ts\*
\p
\v 36 And Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron. And they fought against it.
\v 37 And they captured it and struck it down by the mouth of the sword and its king and all its cities and all the life that was in it. He did not leave a survivor, like all that he had done to Eglon. And he completely destroyed it and all the life that was in it.

\ts\*
\p
\v 38 And Joshua and all Israel with him turned to Debir. And he fought against it.
\v 39 And they captured it and its king and all its cities and struck them down by the mouth of the sword and completely destroyed all the life that was in it; he did not leave a survivor. Just as he had done to Hebron, thus he did to Debir and to its king, and just as he had done to Libnah and to its king.

\ts\*
\p
\v 40 And Joshua struck down all the land: the hill country, and the Negev, and the lowlands, and the slopes, and all their kings. He did not leave a survivor. And he completely destroyed every breathing thing, just as Yahweh the God of Israel had commanded.
\v 41 And Joshua struck them down from Kadesh Barnea and as far as Gaza and all the land of Goshen and as far as Gibeon.

\ts\*
\v 42 And Joshua captured all these kings and their land at one time. For Yahweh the God of Israel fought for Israel.
\v 43 And Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at the Gilgal.

\v 1 And it happened as soon as Jabin the king of Hazor heard, that he sent to Jobab the king of Madon and to the king of Shimron and to the king of Akshaph
\v 2 and to the kings who were from the north in the hill country and in the Arabah south of Kinnereth and in the lowlands and in the heights of Dor from the west,
\v 3 the Canaanite from sunrise and from the west, and the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Jebusite in the hill country and the Hivite below Hermon in the land of the Mizpah.

\ts\*
\v 4 And they went out, they and all their camps with them, many people like the sand that is on the shore of the sea with respect to abundance and very many horses and chariots.
\v 5 And all these kings gathered by appointment and came and camped together at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel.

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid because of their face, because tomorrow at this time I am going to make all of them pierced ones before the face of Israel. You will hamstring their horses and you will burn their chariots with fire.”
\v 7 And Joshua and all the people of war with him came against them suddenly beside the waters of Merom. And they fell on them.

\ts\*
\v 8 And Yahweh gave them into the hand of Israel and they struck them down and chased them as far as Great Sidon and as far as Misrephoth Maim and as far as the Valley of Mizpah toward sunrise. And they struck them down until he did not leave a survivor for them.
\v 9 And Joshua did to them just as Yahweh said to him. He hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.
\ts\*
\p
\v 10 And Joshua returned at that time and captured Hazor, and struck down its king with the sword because Hazor, it was formerly the head of all these kingdoms.
\v 11 And they struck down all the life that was in it by the mouth of the sword, destroying completely, there was not left any breathing thing. And he burned Hazor with fire.

\ts\*
\v 12 And Joshua captured all the cities of these kings and all their kings and struck them down by the mouth of the sword. He completely destroyed them just as Moses the servant of Yahweh had commanded.
\v 13 Only all the cities standing on their mounds, Israel did not burn them, except Hazor, it alone Joshua burned.

\ts\*
\v 14 And all the spoil of these cities and the livestock, the sons of Israel plundered for themselves. Only every man they struck down by the edge of the sword until they had annihilated them. They did not leave any breathing thing.
\v 15 Just as Yahweh had commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did. He did not remove a thing from all that Yahweh had commanded Moses.

\ts\*
\p
\v 16 And Joshua took all this land: the hill country, and all the Negev, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowlands, and the Arabah, and the hill country of Israel, and its lowlands;
\v 17 from Mount Halak the ascent to Seir, and as far as Baal Gad in the valley of the Lebanon below Mount Hermon. And he captured all their kings and struck them down and put them to death.

\ts\*
\v 18 Joshua made war with all these kings many days.
\v 19 There was not a city that made peace with the sons of Israel except the Hivites who dwelled in Gibeon. They took all in battle.
\v 20 For it was from Yahweh to harden their heart to meet battle with Israel in order to completely destroy them, so that there would not be favor for them. But it was in order to annihilate them just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 And Joshua came at that time and cut off the Anakites from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua completely destroyed them with their cities.
\v 22 No Anakites were left in the land of the sons of Israel, except they remained in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod.
\v 23 And Joshua took all the land, according to all that Yahweh had spoken to Moses, and Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to their portions by their tribes. And the land was at rest from war.

\v 2 This is the remaining land: all the territories of the Philistine, and all of the Geshurite,

\v 8 With him the Reubenite and the Gadite had taken their inheritance that Moses gave to them on the other side of the Jordan toward sunrise, just as Moses the servant of Yahweh had given to them:

\v 13 But the sons of Israel did not dispossess the Geshurite and the Maacathite. And Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day.

\p
\v 1 And these are what the sons of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel gave them as an inheritance.
\v 2 Their inheritance was by lot for the nine tribes and the half of the tribe, just as Yahweh had commanded by the hand of Moses.
\ts\*
\v 3 For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half of the tribe from the other side of the Jordan. But to the Levites he had not given an inheritance in the midst of them.
\v 4 For the sons of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. And they did not give a portion to the Levites in the land, but rather cities to dwell in, and their pasturelands for their livestock and for their property.
\v 5 Just as Yahweh had commanded Moses, so the sons of Israel did. And they apportioned the land.

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 And the sons of Judah came near to Joshua in the Gilgal, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You yourself know the word which Yahweh spoke to Moses the man of God on account of me and on account of you at Kadesh Barnea.
\v 7 I was a son of 40 years when Moses the servant of Yahweh sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land. And I brought back word to him just as was in my heart.

\ts\*
\v 8 And my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt. But I was fully after Yahweh my God.
\v 9 And Moses swore on that day, saying, ‘Surely the land on which your foot has trodden will be for an inheritance for you and for your sons until eternity. For you were fully after Yahweh my God.’

\ts\*
\v 10 And now, behold! Yahweh has kept me alive these 45 years, just as he spoke, from when Yahweh spoke this word to Moses, when Israel walked in the wilderness. And now, behold! Today I am a son of 85 years.
\v 11 I am still as strong today just as on the day Moses sent me. As my strength was then, so my strength is now, for war, and for going out, and for coming in.
\v 12 And now, give to me this hill country of which Yahweh spoke on that day. For you yourself heard on that day that the Anakites were there and great fortified cities. Perhaps Yahweh will be with me and I will dispossess them, just as Yahweh has spoken.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And Joshua blessed him and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
\v 14 Therefore, Hebron belongs to Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite for an inheritance until this day, because he was fully after Yahweh the God of Israel.
\v 15 (And the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath Arba. He was a great man among the Anakites.) And the land was at rest from war.

\v 13 And to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion in the midst of the sons of Judah according to the mouth of Yahweh to Joshua: Kiriath Arba (the father of the Anak), it is Hebron.
\v 14 And Caleb dispossessed from there the three sons of the Anak: Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai, the children of the Anak.
\v 15 And he went up from there against those dwelling in Debir. And the name of Debir was formerly Kiriath Sepher.

\ts\*
\v 16 And Caleb said, “Whoever strikes down Kiriath Sepher and captures it, I will give to him Aksah my daughter for a wife.”
\v 17 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, captured it. And he gave to him Aksah his daughter for a wife.

\ts\*
\v 18 And it happened when she came to him, that she incited him to ask for a field from with her father. And she got down from on the donkey, and Caleb said to her, “What is for you?”

\p
\v 1 And the lot was for the tribe of Manasseh (because he was the firstborn of Joseph), for Makir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of the Gilead. And the Gilead and the Bashan were given to him because he himself was a man of war.

\v 16 And the sons of Joseph said, “The hill country is not enough for us, and the chariot of iron is with every Canaanite who dwells in the land of the valley, for those who are in Beth Shan and its daughters and those who are in the valley of Jezreel.”
\v 17 And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, “You are a numerous people and great power is for you. There will not be one lot for you.
\v 18 But the hill country will be for you, though it is a forest, and you will clear it and its exits will be for you. For you will dispossess the Canaanite, though the chariot of iron is for him, though he is strong.”

\v 6 And he shall dwell in that city until he stands before the face of the congregation for judgment, until the death of he who is the great priest in those days. Then the one who kills may return and enter into his city and into his house, into the city that he fled from.’”

\v 1 Then Joshua called to the Reubenite and to the Gadite and to the half of the tribe of Manasseh.
\v 2 And he said to them, “You yourselves have kept all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you. And you have listened to my voice according to all that I have commanded you.
\v 3 You have not forsaken your brothers this many days, until this day. And you have kept the keeping of the commandments of Yahweh your God.

\ts\*
\v 4 And now Yahweh your God has given rest to your brothers, just as he spoke to them. And now, turn and go for yourselves to your tents, to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave to you on the other side of the Jordan.
\v 5 Only watch exceedingly to do the commandment and the law that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you, to love Yahweh your God and to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and to cling to him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your self.”
\v 6 And Joshua blessed them. And he sent them away and they went to their tents.

\ts\*
\p
\v 7 Now to the half of the tribe of Manasseh, Moses had given in the Bashan, and to the half of him, Joshua gave with their brothers on the other side of the Jordan to the sea. And when Joshua had also sent them away to their tents, then he blessed them.
\v 8 And he spoke to them, saying, “Return to your tents with many riches and with very much livestock, with silver and with gold and with bronze and with iron and with very many garments. Apportion the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.”
\v 9 And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half of the tribe of Manasseh turned back and went from with the sons of Israel, from Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of the Gilead, to the land of their possession, it which they had seized for themselves in accordance with the mouth of Yahweh by the hand of Moses.

\ts\*
\p
\v 10 And they entered into the territories of the Jordan that are in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half of the tribe of Manasseh built there an altar beside the Jordan—an altar large of appearance.
\v 11 And the sons of Israel heard, saying, “Behold, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half of the tribe of Manasseh have built the altar at the front of the land of Canaan, at the territories of the Jordan, at the side of the sons of Israel.”
\v 12 And the sons of Israel heard and all the congregation of the sons of Israel assembled at Shiloh to go up for war against them.

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And the sons of Israel sent Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the half of the tribe of Manasseh, into the land of the Gilead.
\v 14 And ten leaders were with him, one leader by one leader of the house of the father of all the tribes of Israel. And they were each a man of the head of the house of their fathers of the thousands of Israel.

\ts\*
\v 15 And they came to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the half of the tribe of Manasseh, into the land of the Gilead. And they spoke with them, saying,
\v 16 “Thus says all the congregation of Yahweh, ‘What is this unfaithfulness that you have done unfaithfully against the God of Israel, to turn today from after Yahweh when you built for yourselves an altar today for your rebelling against Yahweh?

\ts\*
\v 17 Was the iniquity of Peor little for us, it from which we have not purified ourselves until this day? And there was a plague among the congregation of Yahweh.
\v 18 But as for you, you are turning from after Yahweh today! And it will happen that you yourselves will rebel against Yahweh today and tomorrow he will be furious toward all the congregation of Israel.

\ts\*
\v 19 However, if the land of your possession is defiled, cross over for yourselves into the land of the possession of Yahweh, there where the dwelling of Yahweh dwells, and take possession in the midst of us. But do not rebel against Yahweh and do not rebel against us by your building an altar for yourselves apart from the altar of Yahweh our God.
\v 20 Did not Achan the son of Zerah act unfaithfully in unfaithfulness with the banned thing and wrath was on all the congregation of Israel? And he did not perish as one man in his iniquity.’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half of the tribe of Manasseh answered and spoke with the heads of the thousands of Israel:
\v 22 “Yahweh is God of gods! Yahweh is God of gods! He knows, and as for Israel, let it know! If it was in rebellion or if in unfaithfulness against Yahweh, do not save us this day!
\v 23 If it was to build an altar for ourselves to turn from after Yahweh, or if to offer on it burnt up offerings or grain offerings or if to make on it the sacrifices of peace offerings, Yahweh himself will seek out.

\ts\*
\v 24 But no! Because of anxiety from a matter we did this, saying, ‘Tomorrow your sons might say to our sons, saying, “What is for you and for Yahweh, the God of Israel?
\v 25 And Yahweh has given a border between us and between you sons of Reuben and sons of Gad, the Jordan. There is no portion for you in Yahweh.”’ And your sons might make our sons cease so that they are not fearing Yahweh.

\ts\*
\v 26 And we said, ‘Let us now prepare for ourselves to build the altar, not for a burnt up offering and not for a sacrifice.
\v 27 But it will be a witness between us and between you and between our generations after us, to serve the service of Yahweh before his face, with our burnt up offerings and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings. And your sons will not say to our sons tomorrow, “There is no portion for you in Yahweh.”’

\ts\*
\v 28 And we said, ‘And it will happen if they speak to us or to our generations of tomorrow, that we will say, “See the copy of the altar of Yahweh, which our fathers made, not for a burnt up offering and not for a sacrifice, but it is a witness between us and between you.”
\v 29 May it be far from us for us to rebel against Yahweh, and turn today from after Yahweh to build an altar for a burnt up offering, for a grain offering, or for a sacrifice, apart from the altar of Yahweh our God that is before the face of his dwelling!’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 30 And Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the congregation and the heads of the thousands of Israel who were with him heard the words that the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the sons of Manasseh spoke. And it was good in their eyes.
\v 31 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Manasseh, “Today we know that Yahweh is in the midst of us, that you have not acted unfaithfully in this unfaithfulness against Yahweh. Therefore you have rescued the sons of Israel from the hand of Yahweh.”

\ts\*
\v 32 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest and the leaders returned from with the sons of Reuben and from with the sons of Gad, from the land of the Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the sons of Israel. And they brought them back a word.
\v 33 And the word was good in the eyes of the sons of Israel. And the sons of Israel blessed God and did not speak of going up against them for war to destroy the land in which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad were dwelling.
\v 34 And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad called the altar “Truly it is a witness between us that Yahweh is God.”

\v 1 And it happened from many days afterward, when Yahweh had given rest to Israel from all their enemies from all around, that Joshua was old, he came into the days.
\v 2 And Joshua called for all Israel, for its elders and for its heads and for its judges and for its officers. And he said to them, “I am old, I have come into the days.
\v 3 But as for you, you have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to all these nations from your face. For Yahweh your God, he is the one who fights for you.

\ts\*
\v 4 See, I have caused to fall for you these remaining nations as an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan and all the nations that I cut off and the great sea, from the going of the sun.
\v 5 And Yahweh your God, he will push them from your face and will dispossess them from before your face. And you will possess their land, just as Yahweh your God spoke to you.

\ts\*
\v 6 And you shall be very strong to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, to not turn aside from it right or left,
\v 7 to not go among these nations, these remaining ones with you. And by the name of their gods you shall not mention and not swear. And you shall not serve them and not bow down to them.
\v 8 But rather to Yahweh your God you shall cling, just as you have done until this day.

\ts\*
\v 9 And Yahweh has dispossessed great and numerous nations from your face. And as for you, a man has not stood against your face until this day.
\v 10 One man from you pursues a thousand. For Yahweh is your God. He is the one who fights for you, just as he has spoken to you.
\v 11 And you shall keep yourselves exceedingly for your selves, to love Yahweh your God.

\ts\*
\v 12 For if you ever turn back and cling to the remainder of these nations, these remaining ones with you, and you intermarry with them and you go among them and they among you,
\v 13 you shall know assuredly that Yahweh your God will not continue to dispossess these nations from before your face. And they will be to you as a trap and as a snare and as a whip on your sides and as thorns in your eyes, until you perish from on this good ground that Yahweh your God has given to you.

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And behold, today I am about to go the way of all the earth. And you know with all your heart and with all your soul that not one word has fallen from all the good words that Yahweh your God spoke concerning you. The whole has come to you, not one word from it has fallen.
\v 15 And it will happen that just as all the good word that Yahweh your God spoke to you has come upon you, so Yahweh will bring upon you all the evil word until he has destroyed you from this good ground that Yahweh your God has given to you.
\v 16 When you pass over the covenant of Yahweh your God that he commanded you and go and serve other gods and bow down to them, then the nose of Yahweh will burn against you. And you will quickly perish from the good land that he has given to you.”

\v 1 And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem. And he called for the elders of Israel, and for its heads, and for its judges, and for its officers. And they presented themselves before the face of God.
\v 2 And Joshua said to all the people, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘Your fathers dwelled beyond the river from long ago—Terah the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor. And they served other gods.

\ts\*
\v 3 And I took your father Abraham from beyond the river and brought him into all the land of Canaan. And I multiplied his seed and gave to him Isaac.
\v 4 And I gave Jacob and Esau to Isaac. And I gave to Esau the hill country of Seir to possess it. And Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.

\ts\*
\v 5 And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I struck Egypt just as I did within it. And afterward I brought you out.
\v 6 And I brought your fathers out from Egypt, and you came to the sea. And Egypt chased after your fathers with chariot and horsemen to the sea of reeds.

\ts\*
\v 7 And they cried out to Yahweh, and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians. And he brought the sea over him and covered him. And Your eyes saw what I did against Egypt. And you dwelled in the wilderness many days.
\v 8 And I brought you to the land of the Amorite, the ones who dwelled on the other side of the Jordan, and they fought with you. And I gave them into your hand, and you possessed their land, and I destroyed them from before your face.
\ts\*
\v 9 And Balak the son of Zippor, the king of Moab, got up and fought against Israel. And he sent and called for Balaam the son of Beor to curse you.
\v 10 And I was not willing to listen to Balaam. And he blessed you repeatedly, and I rescued you from his hand.

\ts\*
\v 11 And you crossed over the Jordan and came to Jericho. And the men of Jericho, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, fought against you. And I gave them into your hand.
\v 12 And I sent the hornet before your face and it drove them out from before your face—two kings of the Amorite. It was not by your sword and not by your bow.
\v 13 And I gave to you a land for which you did not labor, and cities that you did not build and you dwell in them. You are eating vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant.’

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And now, you shall fear Yahweh and serve him with completeness and with faithfulness. And you shall remove the gods that your fathers served beyond the river and in Egypt, and serve Yahweh.
\v 15 But if it is evil in your eyes to serve Yahweh, choose for yourselves today whom you will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served that were beyond the river, or the gods of the Amorite in whose land you are dwelling. But as for me and my house, we will serve Yahweh.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 16 And the people answered and said, “Far be it for us from leaving Yahweh to serve other gods!
\v 17 For Yahweh is our God, he is the one who brought us and our fathers up from the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery, and who did these great signs before our eyes. And he kept us in all the way in which we went, and among all the peoples among whom we passed.
\v 18 And Yahweh drove out from our face all the peoples, even the Amorite who dwelled in the land. We too, we will serve Yahweh because he is our God.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 19 And Joshua said to the people, “You will not be able to serve Yahweh because he is a holy God. He is a jealous God, he will not lift your transgressions and your sins.
\v 20 If you forsake Yahweh and serve the gods of the foreigner, then he will turn and do harm to you and finish you, after he has done good to you.”

\ts\*
\v 21 And the people said to Joshua, “No, but we will serve Yahweh.”
\v 22 And Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you yourselves have chosen for yourselves Yahweh, to serve him.” And they said, “Witnesses.”
\v 23 “And now, remove the gods of the foreigner that are among you. And bend your heart to Yahweh the God of Israel.”

\ts\*
\v 24 And the people said to Joshua, “We will serve Yahweh our God, and we will listen to his voice.”
\v 25 And Joshua cut a covenant for the people on that day. And he set for them a statute and a judgment in Shechem.
\v 26 And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God. And he took a large stone and set it up there beneath the oak tree that was at the Holy Place of Yahweh.

\ts\*
\p
\v 27 And Joshua said to all the people, “Behold, this stone will be for a witness against us, because it has heard all the words of Yahweh which he spoke to us. And it will be for a witness against you, lest you act deceptively against your God.”
\v 28 And Joshua sent the people away, a man to his inheritance.

\ts\*

\v 29 And it happened after these things that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died, a son of 110 years.
\v 30 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance, in Timnath Serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, from the north of Mount Gaash.
\v 31 And Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who lengthened days after Joshua, and who knew every deed of Yahweh that he had done for Israel.

\ts\*
\p
\v 32 And the bones of Joseph, which the sons of Israel brought up from Egypt, they buried in Shechem, in the portion of the field that Jacob had bought from with the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, with a hundred pieces of money. And it became an inheritance for the sons of Joseph.
\v 33 And Eleazar the son of Aaron died. And they buried him in Gibeah of Phinehas his son, which had been given to him in the hill country of Ephraim.
