\p
\v 1 Now there was one man from the Ramathaim, the Zuphites, from the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.\f + \ft Some modern versions have \fqa Ramathaim Zophim,\fqa* but it is understood that \fqa Zophim\fqa* really refers to the region in which the clan descended from Zuph resided.\f*
\v 2 And for him were two wives: the name of the first was Hannah and the name of the second was Peninnah. And it happened that for Peninnah were children, but for Hannah there were no children.

\ts\*
\v 3 And that man went up from his city from days to days to worship and to sacrifice to Yahweh of hosts in Shiloh. And the two of the sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests of Yahweh, were there.
\v 4 And it happened the day when Elkanah sacrificed that he gave portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters.

\ts\*
\v 5 But to Hannah he would give one portion of two faces, for he loved Hannah. (Now Yahweh had shut her womb.)
\v 6 And her rival would provoke her, even with provocation in order to cause her to thunder, because Yahweh had shut up her womb.

\ts\*
\v 7 And thus it would be year by year, as often as she went up in the house of Yahweh, thus she would provoke her. And she would weep and would not eat.
\v 8 And Elkanah her husband would say to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? And why do you not eat? And why is your heart displeased? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And Hannah got up after eating and after drinking in Shiloh. (Now Eli the priest was sitting upon the seat by the doorway to the temple of Yahweh.)
\v 10 And she was bitter of spirit, and she prayed to Yahweh and wept abundantly.
\v 11 And she vowed a vow and said, “Yahweh of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your female servant and remember me, and not forget your female servant, and give to your female servant a seed of men, then I will give him to Yahweh all the days of his life, and a razor will not go up on his head.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 And it happened when she increased to pray before the face of Yahweh that Eli was watching her mouth.
\v 13 Now Hannah, she was speaking to her heart, only her lips were quivering and her voice was not heard. So Eli thought of her as drunk.
\v 14 And Eli said to her, “Until when will you make yourself drunk? Remove your wine from with you!”

\ts\*
\v 15 And Hannah answered and said, “No, my master, a woman difficult of spirit am I. And wine and intoxicating drink I have not drunk, but I have been pouring out my soul before the face of Yahweh.
\v 16 Do not give your female servant to the face of a daughter of worthlessness. For I have been speaking from the abundance of my complaint and my provocation until now.”

\ts\*
\v 17 And Eli answered and said, “Go in peace. And may the God of Israel grant your request that you requested from with him.”
\v 18 And she said, “May your female servant find favor in your eyes.” And the woman went to her way and she ate. And her face was no longer against her.

\ts\*
\p
\v 19 And they rose early in the morning and worshiped before the face of Yahweh. And they returned and came to their house in the Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife and Yahweh remembered her.
\v 20 And it happened at the turning of the days that Hannah conceived and bore a son. And she called his name Samuel, for, “I requested him from Yahweh.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 And the man Elkanah and all his house went up to sacrifice to Yahweh the sacrifice of the days and his vow.
\v 22 But Hannah did not go up. For she had said to her husband, “Until the boy is weaned, then I will bring him. And he will appear with the face of Yahweh and dwell there until eternity.”
\v 23 And Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do the good thing in your eyes. Stay until you have weaned him. Only, may Yahweh raise up his word.” And the woman stayed and nursed her son until she weaned him.

\ts\*
\v 24 And she brought him up with her when she had weaned him, with three bulls and one ephah of flour and a skin of wine. And she brought him to the house of Yahweh in Shiloh. (Now the boy was a boy.)
\v 25 And they slaughtered the bull. And they brought the boy to Eli.

\ts\*
\v 26 And she said, “Please, my master! As your spirit is alive, my master! I am the woman who was standing with you at here to pray to Yahweh.
\v 27 For this boy I prayed and Yahweh gave to me my request which I had requested from with him.
\v 28 And also I have lent him to Yahweh all the days that he is lent to Yahweh.” And he worshiped Yahweh there.

\ts\*


\c 2
\p
\v 1 And Hannah prayed and said,
\q “My heart exults in Yahweh.
\q My horn is exalted in Yahweh.
\q My mouth is wide against my enemies.
\q For I rejoice in your salvation.

\q
\v 2 There is no one holy like Yahweh.
\q Indeed, there is no one besides you.
\q And there is no rock like our God.

\ts\*
\q
\v 3 Do not speak so much very proudly!
\q Let arrogance go out from your mouth.
\q For Yahweh is a God of knowledge.
\q And by him actions are weighed.
\q
\v 4 Mighty men are shattered of bow.
\q But those who stumble gird on strength.

\ts\*
\q
\v 5 The satisified ones hired themselves out for bread,
\q but the hungry ones cease.
\q Even the barren woman bears seven,
\q but the woman of many sons languishes.

\q
\v 6 Yahweh puts to death and brings to life,
\q brings down to Sheol and brings up.
\q
\v 7 Yahweh makes poor and makes rich,
\q makes low, but also lifts up.

\ts\*
\q
\v 8 Raising the lowly from the dust,
\q he lifts up the needy from the trash heap
\q to make sit with nobles
\q and causes them to inherit the seat of honor.
\q For the pillars of the earth are for Yahweh
\q and he has set the world on them.

\q
\v 9 He will keep the feet of his loyal ones,
\q but the wicked ones will be silenced in the darkness.
\q For not by strength does a man prevail.

\q
\v 10 By Yahweh the ones who oppose him will be shattered.
\q He makes thunder against him in the heavens.
\q Yahweh will judge the ends of the earth.
\q And he will give strength to his king
\q and lift up the horn of his anointed one.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 And Elkanah went to the Ramah, to his house. And the boy was serving Yahweh with the face of Eli the priest.

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 Now the sons of Eli were sons of worthlessness. They did not know Yahweh.
\v 13 And the custom of the priests with the people was: when any man was sacrificing a sacrifice, then the servant of the priest would come with a fork of three prongs in his hand as soon as the meat was boiling.
\v 14 And he would stick it into the pan, or into the kettle, or into the cauldron, or into the pot. All that the fork brought up the priest would take with him. Thus they did to all Israel, the ones who came there at Shiloh.

\ts\*
\v 15 Also, before they burned the fat, the servant of the priest would come, and he would say to the man who was sacrificing, “Give meat to roast for the priest. And he will not take boiled meat from you, but only living.”
\v 16 And the man would say to him, “Let them burn the fat completely as the day, then take for yourself what your self desires,” And he would say, “No, rather now you will give it; and if not, I will take it by force.”
\v 17 And the sin of the young men was very great with the face of Yahweh. For the men spurned the offering of Yahweh.

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And Samuel was serving with the face of Yahweh, a boy girded with an ephod of linen.
\v 19 And his mother would make a small robe for him and she would bring it to him from days to days, when she came up with her husband to sacrifice the sacrifice of the days.

\ts\*
\v 20 And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and would say, “May Yahweh set seed from this woman for you in place of the request that he requested to Yahweh.” And they would go to his place.
\v 21 Because Yahweh visited Hannah, she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew with Yahweh.

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 Now Eli was very old. And he heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel and that they were lying with the women who were serving at the opening of the Tent of Meeting.
\v 23 And he said to them, “Why do you do like these things that I am hearing, your evil things, from with all these people?
\v 24 No, my sons! For the report is not good that I am hearing the people of Yahweh passing on.

\ts\*
\v 25 If a man sins against a man, then God will mediate for him; but if a man sins against Yahweh, who will intercede for him?” And they would not listen to the voice of their father, for Yahweh desired to put them to death.
\v 26 Now the boy Samuel was going and growing, and good, both with Yahweh and also with men.

\ts\*
\p
\v 27 And a man of God came to Eli and said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Did I clearly reveal myself to the house of your father, when they were in Egypt for the house of Pharaoh?
\v 28 And I chose him from all the tribes of Israel to be for me for a priest, to bring up on my altar, to burn incense, to carry an ephod before my face. And I gave to the house of your father all the offerings made by fire of the sons of Israel.

\ts\*
\v 29 Why do you kick at my sacrifice and at my offering that I commanded for the Dwelling, and honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves from the first of every offering of Israel, of my people?’
\v 30 Therefore, this is the declaration of Yahweh the God of Israel: ‘I indeed said your house and the house of your father would walk about before my face until eternity.’ But now this is the declaration of Yahweh: ‘Far be it for me! For I will honor those who honor me, but those who despise me will be slighted.

\ts\*
\v 31 Behold, the days are coming when I will cut off your arm and the arm of the house of your father from there being an old man in your house.
\v 32 And you will see the distress of the Dwelling, in all that he will do good with Israel. And there will not be an old man in your house all the days.
\v 33 But I will not cut off a man from near my altar for you, to cause your eyes to fail and to cause your spirit to grieve. But all the increase of your house will die as men.


\ts\*
\v 34 And this is the sign for you that will come to the two of your sons, to Hophni and Phinehas: in one day the two of them will die.
\v 35 And I will raise up for myself a priest who is faithful. He will do just as is in my heart and in my self. And I will build for him a house that is faithful; and he will walk before the face of my anointed one all the days.
\v 36 And it will happen that all the ones who remain in your house will come to bow down to him for a payment of silver and a round loaf of bread. And he will say, “Please assign me to one of the priestly positions to eat a bit of bread.”’”


\ts\*


\c 3
\p
\v 1 Now the boy Samuel was serving Yahweh before the face of Eli. And the word of Yahweh was rare in those days; there was no widespread vision.
\v 2 And it happened in that day, that Eli was lying down in his place. And his eyes had begun to be dim; he was not able to see.
\v 3 And before the lamp of God had gone out Samuel was lying down in the temple of Yahweh, there where the Box of God was.

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 And Yahweh called to Samuel. And he said, “Here I am.”
\v 5 And he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called to me.” And he said, “I did not call. Go back, lie down.” And he went and lay down.

\ts\*
\v 6 And Yahweh did again call again, “Samuel.” And Samuel rose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called to me.” And he said, “I did not call, my son. Go back, lie down.”
\v 7 (Now it was before Samuel knew Yahweh, and before the word of Yahweh had been revealed to him.)
\v 8 And Yahweh did again call Samuel at the third time. And he rose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called to me.” And Eli understood that Yahweh was calling to the boy.

\ts\*
\v 9 And Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down. And it will happen that, if he calls to you, then you shall say, ‘Speak, Yahweh, for your servant is listening.’” And Samuel went and lay down in his place.
\v 10 And Yahweh came and stationed himself and called as time on time, “Samuel, Samuel.” And Samuel said, “Speak, for your servant is listening.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 And Yahweh said to Samuel, “Behold, I am about to do a thing in Israel that everyone who hears it, the two of his ears will tingle.
\v 12 In that day I will raise against Eli all that I have spoken against his house, beginning and ending.
\v 13 And I have told him that I am about to judge his house until eternity because of the iniquity that he knew. For his sons were cursing against themselves and he did not rebuke them.

\ts\*
\v 14 And therefore, I have sworn to the house of Eli: The iniquity of the house of Eli will not be covered by sacrifice or by offering until eternity.”
\v 15 And Samuel lay down until the morning, and he opened the doors of the house of Yahweh. And Samuel was afraid of telling the vision to Eli.
\v 16 And Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son.” And he said, “Here I am.”

\ts\*
\v 17 And he said, “What is the word that he spoke to you? Do not hide it from me! Thus may God do to you and thus may he add, if you hide from me a word of all the word that he spoke to you.”
\v 18 And Samuel told him all the words, and did not hide it from him. And he said, “It is Yahweh. May he do the good in his eyes.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 19 And Samuel grew. And Yahweh was with him and he did not cause any of his words to fall to the ground.
\v 20 And all Israel from Dan and as far as Beersheba knew that Samuel was faithful as a prophet of Yahweh.
\v 21 And Yahweh continued to appear in Shiloh. For Yahweh revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Yahweh.


\ts\*


\c 4
\p
\v 1 And the word of Samuel was to all Israel.
\p And Israel went out to meet the Philistines for the battle. And they camped at Ebenezer and the Philistines camped at Aphek.
\v 2 And the Philistines lined up to meet Israel and the battle spread and Israel was defeated before the face of the Philistines. And they struck down about 4, 000 men in the battle line in the field.\f + \fq and … spread \ft meaning of Hebrew uncertain\f*

\ts\*
\v 3 And the people came into the camp and the elders of Israel said, “Why did Yahweh strike us today before the face of the Philistines? Let us take for ourselves the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh from Shiloh. And it will come in our midst and it will save us from the palm of our enemies.”
\v 4 And the people sent to Shiloh and from there they lifted the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh of hosts, who sits on the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the Box of the Covenant of God.

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And it happened as soon as the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh came into the camp, that all Israel shouted a great shout. And the earth resounded.
\v 6 And the Philistines heard the sound of the shout, and they said, “What is the sound of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?” Then they knew that the Box of Yahweh had come into the camp.

\ts\*
\v 7 And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, “A god has come into the camp.” And they said, “Woe to us! For it was not like this yesterday and three days ago!
\v 8 Woe to us! Who will rescue us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are they: the gods who struck the Egyptians with every plague in the wilderness.
\v 9 Strengthen yourselves and become men, Philistines, lest you serve for the Hebrews, just as they have served for you. Now become men and fight!”

\ts\*
\v 10 And the Philistines fought, and Israel was struck and fled, a man to his tent, and it was a very great blow. And 30, 000 foot soldiers from Israel fell.
\v 11 And the Box of God was taken. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 And a man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh on that day. And his clothing was torn and earth was on his head.
\v 13 And he came, and behold, Eli was sitting on the seat at the hand of the road watching because his heart was trembling concerning the Box of God. Now the man came to report in the city, and all the city cried out.

\ts\*
\v 14 And Eli heard the sound of the outcry, and he said, “What is the sound of this tumult?” And the man hurried and came and reported to Eli.
\v 15 Now Eli was a son of 98 years. And his eyes were set and he was not able to see.

\ts\*
\v 16 And the man said to Eli, “I am the one who has come from the battle line. As for me, I fled from the battle line today.” And he said, “What was the matter, my son?”
\v 17 And the one who brought news answered and said, “Israel fled before the face of the Philistines. And also, there has been a great blow among the people. And also, the two of your sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died, and the Box of God was taken.”
\v 18 And it happened, as soon as he mentioned the Box of God, that he fell backward from on the seat beside the hand of the gate. And his neck was broken and he died, because the man was old and heavy. And he had judged Israel 40 years.

\ts\*
\p
\v 19 Now his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant, about to give birth. And she heard the news about the Box of God being taken and that her father-in-law and her husband died. And she knelt down and gave birth, for her pains had turned on her.
\v 20 And about the time of her dying, the women who stood over her said, “Do not be afraid, for you have given birth to a son.” But she did not answer and did not put her heart.

\ts\*
\v 21 And she called the boy Ichabod, saying, “The glory has departed from Israel!” about the Box of God being taken, and about her father-in-law and her husband.
\v 22 And she said, “The glory has departed from Israel, because the Box of God has been taken.”

\ts\*


\c 5
\p
\v 1 Now the Philistines had taken the Box of God. And they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.
\v 2 And the Philistines took the Box of God, and brought it to the house of Dagon. And they placed it beside Dagon.
\v 3 And the Ashdodites rose early on the next day, and behold, Dagon had fallen to his face to the ground before the face of the Box of Yahweh! And they took Dagon and returned him to his place.

\ts\*
\v 4 And they rose early in the morning on the next day, and behold, Dagon had fallen to his face to the ground before the face of the Box of Yahweh! And the head of Dagon and the two of the palms of his hands were cut off, on the threshhold. Only Dagon was left on him.
\v 5 Therefore, the priests of Dagon and all the ones who enter the house of Dagon do not tread on the threshhold of Dagon in Ashdod, until this day.

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 And the hand of Yahweh was heavy on the Ashdodites and he devastated them. And he struck them with tumors, Ashdod and its territories.
\v 7 And the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, and they said, “The Box of the God of Israel should not stay with us because his hand is hard on us and on Dagon our god.”
\v 8 And they sent and gathered all of the rulers of the Philistines to them. And they said, “What should we do with the Box of the God of Israel?” And they said, “Let the Box of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath.” And they brought around the Box of the God of Israel.

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And it happened after they brought it around, that the hand of Yahweh was on the city, a very great tumult. And he struck the men of the city from small and as far as great. And tumors broke out to them.
\v 10 And they sent the Box of God to Ekron. And it happened as soon as the Box of God entered Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, “They have brought around to me the Box of the God of Israel to put me and my people to death!”

\ts\*
\v 11 And they sent and gathered all the rulers of the Philistines. And they said, “Send away the Box of the God of Israel, and let it return to its place, and it will not put me and my people to death.” For there was a tumult of death in all the city. The hand of God was very heavy there.
\v 12 And the men who did not die were struck with the tumors. And the cry of the city went up to the heavens.


\ts\*


\c 6
\p
\v 1 And the Box of Yahweh was in the field of the Philistines seven months.
\v 2 And the Philistines called to the priests and to the ones who practice divination, saying, “What should we do for the Box of Yahweh? Make known to us with what we should send it away to its place.”

\ts\*
\v 3 And they said, “If you are about to send away the Box of the God of Israel, do not send it away empty, but surely return to him a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why his hand has not turned aside from you.”
\v 4 And they said, “What is the guilt offering that we should return to him?” And they said, “Five tumors of gold and five mice of gold, from the number of the rulers of the Philistines, for one plague was for all of them and for your rulers.

\ts\*
\v 5 And you shall make images of your tumors and images of your mice, the ones destroying the land, and you shall give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lighten his hand from on you and from on your gods and from on your land.
\v 6 And why do you make heavy your heart, just as the Egyptians and Pharaoh made their heart heavy? When he dealt severely with them, did they not send them away and they went?

\ts\*
\v 7 So now, take and make one new cart with two nursing cows on which a yoke has not gone up. And tie the cows to the cart and return their sons from behind them to the house.
\v 8 And take the Box of Yahweh and put it into the cart, and set the objects of gold that you are returning to him as a guilt offering in the box by its side. And send it away and it will go.
\v 9 And look; if it goes up the way of its own territory, Beth Shemesh, he has done this great evil to us. But if not, then we will know that his hand did not strike us. It happened to us by chance.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 10 And the men did thus, and they took two nursing cows, and tied them to the cart. But they shut up their sons in the house.
\v 11 And they set the Box of Yahweh into the cart with the box and the mice of gold and the images of their tumors.
\v 12 And the cows went straight in the way, on the road of Beth Shemesh. They went in one highway, going and lowing, and they did not turn aside right or left. And the rulers of the Philistines were going after them as far as the border of Beth Shemesh.

\ts\*
\v 13 Now Beth Shemesh was reaping the harvest of wheat in the valley. And they lifted up their eyes and saw the Box, and they rejoiced to see it.
\v 14 And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Bethshemite and stood there, and a large stone was there. And they split the wood pieces of the cart, and offered up the cows as a burnt up offering to Yahweh.

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 And the Levites brought down the Box of Yahweh and the box that was with it, in which was the objects of gold, and they set them on the large stone. And the men of Beth Shemesh offered up burnt up offerings and sacrificed sacrifices on that day to Yahweh.
\v 16 And the five rulers of the Philistines saw and returned to Ekron on that day.

\ts\*
\p
\v 17 And these are the tumors of gold which the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to Yahweh: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron.
\v 18 And the mice of gold were from the number of all the cities of the Philistines of the five rulers, from the cities of fortification and as far as the villages of the open country, and as far as the great Abel on which they rested the Box of Yahweh. It is in the field of Joshua the Bethshemite until this day.

\ts\*
\v 19 And he struck among the men of Beth Shemesh because they had looked in the Box of Yahweh. And he struck 50, 070 men among the people. And the people mourned because Yahweh had stricken a great blow among the people.\f + \ft Instead of \fqa 50,070 men\fqa*, a few later copies and modern versions have, \fqa 70 men\fqa*.\f*
\v 20 And the men of Beth Shemesh said, “Who is able to stand before the face of Yahweh, this holy God? And to whom will he go up from on us?”

\ts\*
\v 21 And they sent messengers to those dwelling in Kiriath Jearim, saying, “The Philistines have returned the Box of Yahweh; come down and bring it up to you.”

\c 7
\p
\v 1 And the men of Kiriath Jearim came and lifted up the Box of Yahweh, and brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill. And they consecrated Eleazar his son to keep the Box of Yahweh.

\ts\*
\p
\v 2 And it happened from the day of the dwelling of the Box in Kiriath Jearim, that the days were numerous, and they were 20 years. And all the house of Israel lamented after Yahweh.
\v 3 And Samuel said to all the house of Israel, saying “If you are going to return to Yahweh with all your heart, remove the gods of the foreigner and the Ashtoreths from your midst. And make firm your heart to Yahweh, and serve him alone, then he will rescue you from the hand of the Philistines.”
\v 4 And the sons of Israel removed the Baals and the Ashtoreths. And they served Yahweh alone.

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to the Mizpah. And I will pray for you to Yahweh.”
\v 6 And they gathered at the Mizpah, and drew water and poured it out before the face of Yahweh. And they fasted on that day and said there, “We have sinned against Yahweh.” And Samuel judged the sons of Israel in the Mizpah.

\ts\*
\v 7 And the Philistines heard that the sons of Israel had gathered at the Mizpah, and the rulers of the Philistines went up against Israel. And the sons of Israel heard, and they were afraid because of the face of the Philistines.
\v 8 And the sons of Israel said to Samuel, “Do not be silent from us, from crying out to Yahweh our God! And may he save us from the hand of the Philistines.”
\v 9 And Samuel took one lamb of milk and he offered it up, a whole burnt up offering to Yahweh. And Samuel cried out to Yahweh for Israel, and Yahweh answered him.

\ts\*
\v 10 (Now Samuel was offering up the burnt up offering, and the Philistines approached for the battle with Israel.) And Yahweh thundered with a great sound on that day against the Philistines and confused them, and they were struck before the face of Israel.
\v 11 And the men of Israel went out from the Mizpah, and they pursued the Philistines and struck them down as far as below Beth Kar.

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 And Samuel took one stone and set it between the Mizpah and the Shen. And he called its name Ebenezer, and he said, “As far as here Yahweh has helped us.”
\v 13 And the Philistines were subdued and did not do again to enter the border of Israel. And the hand of Yahweh was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
\v 14 And the cities that the Philistines had taken from with Israel were returned to Israel, from Ekron and as far as Gath. And Israel rescued their territory from the hand of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
\v 16 And he went as often as year by year and went around Bethel, and the Gilgal, and the Mizpah. And he judged Israel, all these places.
\v 17 And his returning place was the Ramah, because his house was there; and there he judged Israel. And he built an altar there to Yahweh.


\ts\*


\c 8
\p
\v 1 And it happened when Samuel was old, that he appointed his sons judges of Israel.
\v 2 And the name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah. They were judges in Beersheba.
\v 3 But his sons did not walk in his ways, and they reached out after dishonest gain. And they took a bribe and perverted justice.

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 And all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at the Ramah.
\v 5 And they said to him, “Behold, you are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint for us a king to judge us like all the nations.”
\v 6 And the matter was evil in the eyes of Samuel when they said, “Give to us a king to judge us.” And Samuel prayed to Yahweh.

\ts\*
\p
\v 7 And Yahweh said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people according to all that they say to you. For they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from reigning over them.
\v 8 Like all the deeds that they have done from the day I brought them up from Egypt and until this day, they have forsaken me and served other gods. So they are doing also to you.
\v 9 And now, listen to their voice. However, solemnly warn them and tell them the custom of the king who will rule over them.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 10 And Samuel said all the words of Yahweh to the people who were requesting a king from him.
\v 11 And he said, “This will be the custom of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them for himself in his chariots and among his horsemen, and they will run before the face of his chariot;
\v 12 and appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and to plow his plowing, and to harvest his harvest, and to make the implements of his warfare and the implements of his chariot.

\ts\*
\v 13 And he will take your daughters for perfumers and for cooks and for bakers.
\v 14 And your fields and your vineyards and your olive orchards, the good ones, he will take and give to his servants.
\v 15 And he will take a tenth of your seeds and your vineyards, and give to his officials and to his servants.

\ts\*
\v 16 And your male servants and your female servants and your young men, the good ones, and your donkeys he will take and make for his work.
\v 17 He will take a tenth of your flock. And you yourselves will be for him for servants.
\v 18 And on that day you will cry out from before the face of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves. But Yahweh will not answer you on that day.”

\ts\*
\v 19 And the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel. And they said, “No! But a king will be over us.
\v 20 And we also, we will be like all the nations. And our king will judge us and go out before our face and fight our battles.”

\ts\*
\v 21 And Samuel heard all the words of the people. And he spoke them in the ears of Yahweh.
\v 22 And Yahweh said to Samuel, “Listen to their voice and cause a king to reign for them.” And Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Go, a man to his city.”

\p
\v 1 And there was a man from Benjamin and his name was Kish the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bekorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a man of a Yaminite, a mighty one of strength.
\v 2 And for him was a son and his name was Saul, a young man and good. And there was no man from the sons of Israel better than him. From his shoulder and upward he was taller than all the people.

\ts\*
\v 3 Now the female donkeys of Kish, the father of Saul, were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, “Take now one from the servants with you, and rise, go seek the female donkeys.”
\v 4 And he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find them. And they passed through the land of Shaalim, but there was nothing. And he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they did not find them.

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 They themselves entered in the land of Zuph, and Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, let us return, lest my father cease about the female donkeys and worry about us.”
\v 6 And he said to him, “Behold, please, a man of God is in this city, and the man is honored; all that he speaks certainly comes. Let us go there now. Perhaps he will tell us our way on which we have gone.”

\ts\*
\v 7 And Saul said to his servant, “Now behold, we will go, but what will we bring to the man? For the bread is gone from our vessels and there is no gift to bring to the man of God. What is with us?”
\v 8 And the servant added to answer Saul, and he said, “Behold, one-fourth of a shekel of silver has been found in my hand. And I will give it to the man of God and he will tell us our way.”

\ts\*
\v 9 (Before in Israel, a man said thus when he went to seek God, “Come and let us go to the seer.” For the prophet today was called the seer before.)
\v 10 And Saul said to his servant, “Your word is good. Come, let us go.” And they went to the city there where the man of God was.
\v 11 They were going up on the ascent to the city, and they themselves found young women going out to draw water. And they said to them, “Is the seer in this place?”

\ts\*
\v 12 And they answered them, and said, “There is, behold, before your face. Hurry now, for today he has come to the city, because the sacrifice of the day is for the people at the high place.
\v 13 As soon as you enter the city then you will find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat until he comes, because he himself will bless the sacrifice; afterwards the ones who are called will eat. So now go up, for, as for him, you will find him as soon as today.”
\v 14 And they went up to the city. They were entering in the midst of the city, and behold, Samuel was going out to meet them to go up to the high place.

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 Now Yahweh had uncovered the ear of Samuel one day before the coming of Saul, saying:
\v 16 “About this time tomorrow I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be ruler over my people Israel. And he will save my people from the hand of the Philistines. For I have seen my people, for its cry has come to me.”

\ts\*
\v 17 And Samuel saw Saul, and Yahweh answered him, “Behold, the man whom I said to you! This one will restrain my people.”
\v 18 And Saul approached Samuel in the midst of the gate. And he said, “Please tell me, where is the house of the seer?”

\ts\*
\v 19 And Samuel answered Saul and said, “I am the seer. Go up before my face to the high place, and you will eat with me today. And I will send you away in the morning, and I will tell you all that is in your heart.
\v 20 As for your female donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not set your heart to them, for they have been found. Now for whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not for you and for all the house of your father?”
\v 21 And Saul answered and said, “Am I not a Benjamite, from the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my clan the least from all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Yet why have you spoken to me like this word?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them to the room. And he gave to them a place at the head of the ones who had been called. (Now they were about 30 men.)
\v 23 And Samuel said to the cook, “Give the portion which I gave to you, of which I said to you, ‘Set it with you.’”
\v 24 And the cook lifted the thigh and what was on it and set it before the face of Saul. And he said, “Behold, what has been left over is set before your face. Eat, because it has been kept for you for the appointed time, saying, ‘I have called the people.’” And Saul ate with Samuel on that day.

\ts\*
\p
\v 25 And they came down from the high place to the city. And he spoke with Saul on the roof.
\v 26 And they rose early. And it happened as soon as the dawn went up that Samuel called to Saul on the roof, saying, “Get up and I will send you away.” And Saul got up, and the two of them went out, he and Samuel, to the outside.
\v 27 They were going down to the end of the city, and Samuel said to Saul, “Speak to the servant so he may pass on before our face,”and he passed on. “But you stand now, and I will cause you to hear the word of God.”

\c 10
\p
\v 1 And Samuel took a flask of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him. And he said, “Is it not Yahweh who has anointed you to be ruler over his inheritance?
\v 2 When you go today from with me, then you will find two men near the tomb of Rachel in the territory of Benjamin in Zelzah. And they will say to you, ‘The female donkeys that you went to seek have been found. And behold, your father has stopped the matter of the female donkeys and is worried about you, saying, “What should I do about my son?”’

\ts\*
\v 3 And you will go on from there and further, and you will come as far as the oak of Tabor. And you will find three men there going up to God at Bethel, one carrying three young goats, and one carrying three round loaves of bread, and one carrying a skin of wine.
\v 4 And they will ask about you with respect to well-being and give to you two bread loaves, and you will take from their hand.

\ts\*
\v 5 Afterward you will come to the hill of God, there where the garrisons of the Philistines are. And it will happen as soon as you come there to the city, that you will meet a group of prophets going down from the high place. And before their face will be a harp and a tambourine and a flute and a lyre. And they will be prophesying.
\v 6 And the spirit of Yahweh will rush on you, and you will prophesy with them. And you will be changed into another man.

\ts\*
\v 7 And it will happen that when these signs come to you, do for yourself what your hand finds, for God is with you.
\v 8 And go down before my face to the Gilgal. And behold, I will come down to you to offer up burnt up offerings, to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings. Wait seven days until my coming to you and I will make known to you what you shall do.”
\v 9 And it happened as soon as he turned his shoulder to go from with Samuel, that God turned for him another heart. And all these signs came on that day.

\ts\*
\p
\v 10 And they came there to the hill, and behold, a group of prophets met him. And the spirit of God rushed on him and he prophesied in their midst.
\v 11 And it happened that every one who knew him from yesterday and three days ago saw, and behold, he prophesied with the prophets! And the people said, a man to his neighbor, “What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”
\v 12 And a man from there answered and said, “And who is their father?” Therefore, it became a proverb, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”
\v 13 And he finished from prophesying, and he came to the high place.

\ts\*
\v 14 And the uncle of Saul said to him and to his servant, “Where did you go?” And he said, “To seek the female donkeys. And we saw that there was nothing, and we went to Samuel.”
\v 15 And the uncle of Saul said, “Please tell me what Samuel said to you.”
\v 16 And Saul said to his uncle, “He told us indeed that the female donkeys had been found.” But he did not tell him the word of the kingship, which Samuel had said.

\ts\*
\p
\v 17 And Samuel called together the people to Yahweh at the Mizpah.
\v 18 And he said to the sons of Israel, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘I myself brought up Israel from Egypt. And I rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians, and from the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you.’

\ts\*
\v 19 But you today have rejected your God, him who saves you from all your calamities and your distresses. And you have said to him, ‘Rather set a king over us.’ And now station yourselves before the face of Yahweh according to your tribes and according to your thousands.”
\v 20 And Samuel brought near all the tribes of Israel. And the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
\v 21 And he brought near the tribe of Benjamin according to its clans, and the clan of the Matrites was taken. And Saul the son of Kish was taken and they sought him, but he was not found.

\ts\*
\v 22 And they asked of Yahweh again, “Has a man come here yet?” And Yahweh said, “Behold, he has hidden himself with the things.”
\v 23 And they ran and took him from there. And he stationed himself in the midst of the people. And he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
\v 24 And Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see him whom Yahweh has chosen? Indeed there is no one like him among all the people!” And all the people saw and said, “May the king live!”

\ts\*
\p
\v 25 And Samuel spoke to the people the ordinance of the kingship, and he wrote it in the book, and rested it before the face of Yahweh. And Samuel sent away all the people, a man to his house.
\v 26 And Saul also went to his house at Gibeah. And with him went the mighty whose hearts God had touched.
\v 27 But the sons of worthlessness said, “How can this one save us?” And they despised him and did not bring to him a gift. But he was like one being silent.

\v 1 And Nahash the Ammonite went up and camped against Jabesh Gilead. And all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Cut a covenant for us, and we will serve you.”
\v 2 And Nahash the Ammonite said to them, “By this will I cut for you, by gouging out for you every right eye. And I will set it as a disgrace against all Israel.”

\ts\*
\v 3 And the elders of Jabesh said to him, “Leave us alone seven days, so that we may send messengers through all the territory of Israel. And if there is no one to save us, then we will go out to you.”
\v 4 And the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, and they spoke the words in the ears of the people. And all the people lifted up their voice and wept.

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And behold, Saul was coming behind the cattle from the field. And Saul said, “What is for the people that they are weeping?” And they recounted to him the words of the men of Jabesh.
\v 6 And the Spirit of God rushed on Saul when he heard these words. And his nose burned exceedingly.
\v 7 And he took a pair of cattle, and cut it into pieces, and sent away through all the territory of Israel by the hand of the messengers, saying, “Whoever is not coming out behind Saul and behind Samuel, thus will be done to his cattle.” And the dread of Yahweh fell on the people, and they went out as one man.
\v 8 And he mustered them at Bezek. And the sons of Israel were 300, 000, and the men of Judah were 30, 000.

\ts\*
\v 9 And they said to the messengers who had come, “Thus you will say to the men of Jabesh Gilead, ‘Tomorrow deliverance will be for you, at the heat of the sun.’” And the messengers went and told the men of Jabesh, and they rejoiced.
\v 10 And the men of Jabesh said, “Tomorrow we will go out to you. And you may do to us according to all the good in your eyes.”

\v 11 And it happened from the next day that Saul set the people in three heads. And they came into the midst of the camp at the watch of the morning, and they struck down Ammon until the heat of the day. And it happened that the remaining ones were scattered, and two among them did not remain together.
\v 12 And the people said to Samuel, “Who are those who said, ‘Will Saul reign over us?’ Give the men, and we will put them to death.”
\v 13 And Saul said, “A man shall not be put to death on this day. For today Yahweh has done a deliverance in Israel.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And Samuel said to the people, “Come, and let us go to the Gilgal. And let us renew the kingship there.”
\v 15 And all the people went to the Gilgal and caused Saul to reign there before the face of Yahweh in the Gilgal. And there they sacrificed sacrifices, peace offerings, before the face of Yahweh. And there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced up to abundance.

\v 1 And Samuel said to all Israel, “Behold, I have listened to your voice, according to all that you said to me. And I have caused a king to reign over you.
\v 2 And now, behold the king is walking about before your face. And as for me, I am old and gray; and my sons, behold they are with you. And I myself have walked about before your face from my youth until this day.

\ts\*
\v 3 Here I am! Testify against me in front of Yahweh and in front of his anointed one. Whose ox have I taken, or whose donkey have I taken, or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed or from whose hand have I taken a bribe so that I hid my eyes with it? And I will restore to you.”
\v 4 And they said, “You have not defrauded us, and have not oppressed us, and have not taken anything from the hand of a man.”
\v 5 And he said to them, “Yahweh is a witness against you, and his anointed one is a witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.” And he said,“Witness.”

\ts\*

\v 6 And Samuel said to the people, “It is Yahweh who made Moses and Aaron, and who brought up your fathers from the land of Egypt.
\v 7 And now, station yourselves so that I may be judged with you before the face of Yahweh with all the righteous deeds of Yahweh, which he did with you and with your fathers.

\ts\*
\v 8 When Jacob came to Egypt, and your fathers cried out to Yahweh, then Yahweh sent Moses and Aaron, and they brought out your fathers from Egypt and they caused them to dwell in this place.
\v 9 And they forgot Yahweh their God. And he sold them into the hand of Sisera, the commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab. And they fought against them.

\ts\*
\v 10 And they cried out to Yahweh and said, ‘We have sinned, because we have forsaken Yahweh and have served the Baals and the Ashtoreths. And now rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.’
\v 11 And Yahweh sent Jerub Baal and Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel. And he rescued you from the hand of your enemies from all around you, and you dwelled securely.

\ts\*
\v 12 And you saw that Nahash the king of the sons of Ammon came against you, and you said to me, ‘No! Rather a king will reign over us.’ But Yahweh your God was your king.
\v 13 And now, behold the king whom you have chosen, whom you have requested! And behold, Yahweh has given a king over you!

\ts\*
\v 14 If you fear Yahweh and serve him and listen to his voice and do not rebel against the mouth of Yahweh, then both you and the king who reigns over you will be after Yahweh your God.
\v 15 But if you do not listen to the voice of Yahweh, and you rebel against the mouth of Yahweh, then the hand of Yahweh will be against you and against your fathers.

\ts\*
\v 16 Even now station yourselves and see this great thing that Yahweh is about to do before your eyes.
\v 17 Is it not the harvest of wheat today? I will call to Yahweh, and he will give thunder and rain. And know and see that your evil is great, which you have done in the eyes of Yahweh, by requesting a king for yourselves.”

\p
\v 18 And Samuel called to Yahweh, and Yahweh gave thunder and rain on that day. And all the people greatly feared Yahweh and Samuel.
\v 19 And all the people said to Samuel, “Pray for your servants to Yahweh your God, so that we may not die. For we have added evil onto all our sins by requesting a king for ourselves.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 20 And Samuel said to the people, “Do not fear. You yourselves have done all this evil. Only do not turn aside from after Yahweh, but serve Yahweh with all your heart.
\v 21 And do not turn aside! For it is after the empty thing that does not profit and does not rescue, because they are emptiness.

\ts\*
\v 22 For Yahweh will not leave his people, for the sake of his great name. For Yahweh was pleased to make you into a people for himself.
\v 23 Also me, far be it for me from sinning against Yahweh by ceasing to pray for you. And I will instruct you in the good and straight way.

\v 24 Only fear Yahweh and serve him in faithfulness with all your heart. Indeed, see what he has made great with you!

\v 1 Saul was a son of a year when he reigned. And he reigned over Israel two years.\f + \fq Saul was a son of a year \ft appears to be missing a number in the Hebrew text. Some ancient versions are missing the verse entirely, while others have \fq 30 years.\f*
\v 2 And Saul chose for himself 3, 000 from Israel. And 2, 000 were with Saul in Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and 1, 000 were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. And the rest of the people he sent away, a man to his tent.

\ts\*
\v 3 And Jonathan struck down the garrison of the Philistines that was at Geba and the Philistines heard. And Saul blew with the horn in all the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!”
\v 4 And all Israel heard, saying, “Saul struck down the garrison of the Philistines, and also Israel has become a stench among the Philistines.” And the people were called together after Saul at the Gilgal.

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And the Philistines gathered to fight against Israel: 30, 000 chariots and 6, 000 horsemen and a people like the sand that is on the shore of the sea wiith respect to abundance. And they went up and camped at Michmash, east of Beth Aven.
\v 6 And the men of Israel saw that it was narrow for them, for the people were hard-pressed. And the people hid themselves in the caves and in the thornbushes and in the cliffs and in the underground chambers and in the pits.
\v 7 And Hebrews crossed over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. But Saul was still at the Gilgal and all the people trembled after him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And he waited seven days to the appointed time when Samuel would be there, but Samuel did not come to the Gilgal. And the people scattered from beside him.
\v 9 And Saul said, “Bring near to me the burnt up offering and the peace offerings.” And he offered up the burnt up offering.
\v 10 And it happened as soon as he finished offering up the burnt up offering that, behold, Samuel came! And Saul went out to meet him to bless him.

\ts\*
\v 11 And Samuel said, “What have you done?” And Saul said, “When I saw that the people scattered from beside me, and you, you did not come by the appointed time of days, and the Philistines were gathering at Michmash,
\v 12 then I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at the Gilgal, and I have not appeased the face of Yahweh.’ So I forced myself and offered up the burnt up offering.”

\ts\*
\v 13 And Samuel said to Saul, “You have acted foolishly! You have not kept the command of Yahweh your God that he commanded you. For then Yahweh would have established your reign over Israel until eternity.
\v 14 But now your reign will not stand. Yahweh has sought for himself a man according to his heart, and Yahweh has commanded him to be leader over his people, for you did not keep what Yahweh commanded you.”

\ts\*

\v 15 And Samuel rose and went up from the Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul mustered the people who were found with him, about 600 men.
\v 16 Now Saul and Jonathan his son and the people who were found with him were staying in Geba of Benjamin. And the Philistines camped at Michmash.

\ts\*
\v 17 And destroyers went out from the camp of the Philistines, three heads. One head turned to the way of Ophrah, to the land of Shual.
\v 18 And one head turned the way of Beth Horon. And one head turned the way of the border that looks down over the valley of Zeboyim, toward the wilderness.

\ts\*
\p
\v 19 Now a blacksmith could not be found in all the land of Israel. For the Philistines said, “Lest the Hebrews make sword or spear.”
\v 20 And all Israel used to go down to the Philistines, a man to sharpen his plow and his mattock and his axe and his sickle.
\v 21 And the charge was a pim for the plowshares and for the mattocks and for three picks and for the axes and for straightening the goads.

\ts\*
\v 22 And it happened on the day of battle that a sword or spear was not found in the hands of any of the people who were with Saul and with Jonathan, but was found for Saul and for his son Jonathan.

\p
\v 1 And it happened one day that Jonathan the son of Saul said to his servant who carried his equipment, “Come, and let us cross over to the garrison of the Philistines that is on the other side from here.” But he did not tell his father.
\v 2 Now Saul was staying at the end of the Gibeah under the pomegranate tree that is in Migron. And the people who were with him were about 600 men,

\ts\*
\v 3 and Ahijah the son of Ahitub the brother of Ichabod the son of Phinehas the son of Eli, the priest of Yahweh at Shiloh who was carrying an ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone.
\v 4 Now between the passes that Jonathan sought to pass over to the garrison of the Philistines was the tooth of the cliff on one side from this and the tooth of the cliff on the other side from this. And the name of one was Bozez and the name of one was Seneh.
\v 5 The tooth of the one was a pillar from the north in front of Michmash. And the one from the south was in front of Geba.

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 And Jonathan said to his servant who carried his equipment, “Come, and let us pass over to the garrison of these uncircumcised ones! Perhaps Yahweh will act for us, for there is no hindrance for Yahweh to save by many or by few.”
\v 7 And the one who carried his equipment said to him, “Do all that is in your heart. Turn for yourself; behold, I am with you according to your heart.”

\ts\*
\v 8 And Jonathan said, “Behold, we will cross over to the men. And we will reveal ourselves to them.
\v 9 If thus they say to us, ‘Be still until we reach you,’ then we will stand under ourselves and not go up to them.

\ts\*
\v 10 But if thus they say, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up, for Yahweh has given them into our hand. And this will be the sign for us.”
\v 11 And the two of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines. And the Philistines said, “Behold, Hebrews are coming out from the holes there where they have hidden themselves.”
\v 12 And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and the one who carried his equipment, and said, “Come up to us, and we will cause you to know a thing.” And Jonathan said to the one who carried his equipment, “Go up behind me, for Yahweh has given them into the hand of Israel.”

\ts\*
\v 13 And Jonathan went up on his hands and on his feet, and the one who carried his equipment was behind him. And they fell before the face of Jonathan, and the one who carried his equipment was putting to death behind him.
\v 14 And the first blow that Jonathan and the one who carried his equipment struck was about 20 men in about half of a furrow, a yoke of a field.

\ts\*
\v 15 And a trembling was in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. The garrison and the destroyers, even they trembled. And the earth quaked and it became a trembling of God.
\v 16 And the lookouts of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the crowd melted away and went even here.

\v 17 And Saul said to the people who were with him, “Muster now and see who has gone from with us.” And they mustered, and behold, there was no Jonathan or the one who carried his equipment!

\ts\*
\v 18 And Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring near the Box of God.” For on that day the Box of God was with the sons of Israel.
\v 19 And it happened while Saul spoke to the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines was going continually and increasingly. And Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.”

\ts\*
\v 20 And Saul and all the people who were with him were called together and came to the battle. And behold, the sword of a man was against his companion, a very great confusion.
\v 21 Now some Hebrews were for the Philistines according to yesterday and three days ago, who had gone up with them into the camp all around. But even they were to be with Israel, who were with Saul and Jonathan.

\ts\*
\v 22 And all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines fled, and they also pursued after them in the battle.
\v 23 And Yahweh saved Israel on that day. And the battle passed over Beth Aven.

\ts\*
\p
\v 24 And the men of Israel were hard-pressed on that day. And Saul had made the people swear, saying, “Cursed is the man who eats food until the evening and I take vengeance from my enemies.” So all the people had not tasted food.
\v 25 And all the land entered into the forest. And honey was on the face of the field.
\v 26 And the people entered into the forest, and behold, the flowing of honey! But no one reached his hand to his mouth for the people feared the oath.

\ts\*
\v 27 But Jonathan had not heard when his father had made the people swear. And he extended the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb of the honey. And he returned his hand to his mouth and his eyes became bright.
\v 28 And a man from the people answered and said, “Your father surely made the people swear, saying, ‘Cursed is the man who eats food today.’ So the people are faint.”

\ts\*
\v 29 And Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land. See now that my eyes have become bright because I tasted a little of this honey.
\v 30 How much more if the people had eaten freely today from the plunder of their enemies that they found? For now the blow has not been great among the Philistines.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 31 And on that day they struck down the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very faint.
\v 32 And the people rushed with shouting on the plunder and took sheep and cattle and sons of cattle, and they slaughtered on the ground. And the people ate with the blood.

\ts\*
\v 33 Then they told Saul, saying, “Behold, the people are sinning against Yahweh by eating with the blood!” And he said, “You have acted deceptively. Roll a big stone to me today.”
\v 34 And Saul said, “Disperse among the people and say to them, ‘Bring near to me, a man his ox and a man his sheep, and slaughter here and eat. And you shall not sin against Yahweh by eating with the blood.’” And all the people brought near, a man his ox by his hand that night and they slaughtered there.

\v 37 And Saul asked of God, “Should I go down after the Philistines? Will you give them into the hand of Israel?” But he did not answer him on that day.

\ts\*
\v 38 And Saul said, “Come near here, all the corners of the people! And know and see by what this sin has happened today.
\v 39 For, as Yahweh is alive, the one who saves Israel, even if it is by Jonathan my son, indeed he will surely die.” But there was no one answering him from all the people.

\v 40 And he said to all Israel, “You will be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on one side.” And the people said to Saul, “Do the good in your eyes.”

\v 43 And Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” And Jonathan told him and said, “Indeed I tasted a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am; I will die.”

\v 45 And the people said to Saul, “Should Jonathan die, who has made this great salvation in Israel? Far from it! As Yahweh is alive, a hair of his head will not fall to the ground! For he has worked with God this day.” And the people ransomed Jonathan and he did not die.

\v 46 And Saul went up from after the Philistines. And the Philistines went to their place.

\v 1 And Samuel said to Saul, “Yahweh sent me to anoint you as king over his people, over Israel. And now, listen to the voice of the words of Yahweh.
\v 2 Thus says Yahweh of hosts, ‘I have noted what Amalek did to Israel when he set against him on the way when he came up from Egypt.
\v 3 Now go and strike down Amalek and completely destroy all that is for him, and do not have compassion on him. But put to death from man as far as woman, from child and as far as infant, from ox and as far as sheep, from camel and as far as donkey.’”

\v 4 And Saul caused the people to hear and mustered them at the Telaim: 200, 000 on foot, and 10, 000 men of Judah.

\v 6 And Saul said to the Kenites, “Go, depart, go down from the midst of the Amalekite, lest I remove you with him. As for you, you did kindness with all the sons of Israel when they came up from Egypt.” And the Kenites departed from the midst of Amalek.
\v 7 And Saul struck down Amalek, from Havilah as you enter Shur, which is on the face of Egypt.

\v 8 And he seized Agag the king of Amalek alive. But he completely destroyed all the people by the mouth of the sword.

\v 10 And the word of Yahweh was to Samuel, saying,
\v 11 “I regret that I have caused Saul to reign as king, for he has turned from after me and has not raised up my words.” And it was hot for Samuel, and he cried out to Yahweh all the night.

\ts\*
\v 12 And Samuel rose early in the morning to meet Saul. And it was told to Samuel, saying, “Saul came to the Carmel, and behold, he is setting up a monument for himself! And he turned around and passed over and went down to the Gilgal.”
\v 13 And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, “Blessed are you by Yahweh! I have raised up the word of Yahweh.”

\ts\*
\v 14 And Samuel said, “And what is the sound of this flock in my ears? And the sound of the cattle that I am hearing?”
\v 15 And Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekite. For the people had compassion on the best of the sheep and the cattle, in order to sacrifice to Yahweh your God. But the excess we have completely destroyed.”
\v 16 And Samuel said to Saul, “Stop, and let me tell you what Yahweh spoke to me at night.” And he said to him, “Speak!”

\ts\*
\p
\v 17 And Samuel said, “Although you are small in your own eyes, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? And Yahweh anointed you as king over Israel.
\v 18 And Yahweh sent you on your way. And he said, ‘Go and completely destroy the sinners, Amalek. And fight against them until they have finished them.’
\v 19 And why did you not listen to the voice of Yahweh? But you rushed with shouting on the spoil and you did evil in the eyes of Yahweh.”

\ts\*

\v 20 And Saul said to Samuel, “I have listened to the voice of Yahweh, and have gone on the way that Yahweh sent me. And I have brought Agag the king of Amalek and have completely destroyed Amalek.
\v 21 And the people took from the spoil sheep and cattle, the first of the banned thing, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God at the Gilgal.”

\ts\*
\v 22 And Samuel said, “Is the delight of Yahweh in burnt up offerings and sacrifices, as in listening to the voice of Yahweh? Behold, listening is better than sacrifice, paying attention is more than the fat of rams.
\v 23 For rebellion is the sin of divination, and to display pushing is iniquity and idols. Because you have rejected the word of Yahweh, he has rejected you from being king.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 24 And Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned! For I have passed over the mouth of Yahweh and your words, because I feared the people and listened to their voice.
\v 25 And now, please lift up my sin. And return with me so I may worship Yahweh.”

\ts\*
\v 26 And Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you. For you have rejected the word of Yahweh, and Yahweh has rejected you from being king over Israel.”
\v 27 And Samuel turned around to go. And he grabbed the edge of his robe, and it was torn.

\ts\*
\v 28 And Samuel said to him, “Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel from on you today. And he has given it to your companion, the better one than you.
\v 29 And also, the Perpetual One of Israel will not act falsely and will not change his mind. For he is not a man, changing his mind.”

\ts\*
\v 30 And he said, “I have sinned! Now please honor me in front of the elders of my people and in front of Israel. And return with me, so I may worship Yahweh your God.”

\v 32 And Samuel said, “Bring near to me Agag the king of Amalek.” And Agag went to him in bonds. And Agag said, “Surely the bitterness of death has turned aside.”

\v 34 And Samuel went to the Ramah. And Saul went up to his house at Gibeah of Saul.

\v 1 And Yahweh said to Samuel, “Until when will you be mourning for Saul, while I myself have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have seen among his sons a king for me.”
\v 2 And Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears, then he will slay me.” And Yahweh said, “Take a heifer of the cattle in your hand and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh.’
\v 3 And call for Jesse at the sacrifice, and I myself will show you what you shall do. And you shall anoint for me whom I say to you.”

\ts\*
\v 4 And Samuel did what Yahweh had spoken and he came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the city trembled to meet him and said, “Are you coming in peace?”
\v 5 And he said, “In peace; I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh. Consecrate yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.” And he consecrated Jesse and his sons and called them to the sacrifice.

\ts\*
\v 6 And it happened when they came, that he saw Eliab. And he said, “Surely in front of Yahweh is his anointed one.”
\v 7 And Yahweh said to Samuel, “Do not look on his outward appearance or on the height of his stature because I have rejected him. For it is not what the man sees, for the man sees by the eyes, but Yahweh sees to the heart.”

\ts\*
\v 8 And Jesse called for Abinadab and made him pass over before the face of Samuel. And he said, “Also Yahweh has not chosen this one.”
\v 9 And Jesse made Shammah pass over. And he said, “Also Yahweh has not chosen this one.”
\v 10 And Jesse made seven of his sons pass over before the face of Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, “Yahweh has not chosen among these.”

\ts\*
\v 11 And Samuel said to Jesse, “Are your young men complete?” And he said, “The youngest one still remains, and behold, he is tending among the flock.” And Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and get him, for we will not turn around until he comes here.”
\v 12 And he sent and brought him. (Now he was ruddy with beautiful eyes and a good appearance.) And Yahweh said, “Rise, anoint him, for this is he.”

\ts\*
\v 13 And Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the middle of his brothers. And the Spirit of Yahweh rushed on David from that day and onward. And Samuel rose and went to the Ramah.

\v 14 Now the Spirit of Yahweh turned aside from with Saul, and a spirit of evil from with Yahweh terrified him.
\v 15 And the servants of Saul said to him, “
“Behold, an evil spirit of God is terrifying you.
\v 16 Let our master please say to your servants before your face, “,
‘Seek a man who knows how to play on the lyre.’ And it will happen that when the evil spirit of God is on you, then he will play by his hand and it will be good for you.”

\ts\*
\v 17 And Saul said to his servants, “See now for me a man who is good at playing and bring him to me.”
\v 18 And one from the young men answered and said, “Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, knowing how to play and mighty of strength and a man of war and discerning of word and a man of appearance. And Yahweh is with him.”
\v 19 And Saul sent messengers to Jesse. And he said, “Send to me David your son, who is with the flock.”

\ts\*
\v 20 And Jesse took a donkey, bread, and a skin of wine, and one kid of the goats, and he sent them by the hand of David his son to Saul.

\v 22 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, “Let David now stand before my face, for he has found favor in my eyes.”

\v 4 And a man of the space between came out from the camp of the Philistines, Goliath was his name, from Gath. His height was six cubits and a span.

\v 6 And shin guards of bronze were on his legs. And a javelin of bronze was between his shoulders.

\v 8 And he stood and called out to the ranks of Israel, and he said to them, “Why have you come out to arrange for battle? Am not I a Philistine, and you, servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to me.
\v 9 If he is able to fight with me and strike me down, then we will become servants for you. But if I prevail against him and strike him down, then you will become servants for us and you will serve us.”

\ts\*
\v 10 And the Philistine said, “I myself taunt the ranks of Israel this day. Give to me a man so we may fight together.”
\v 11 And Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine. And they were dismayed and feared greatly.

\v 12 Now David was the son of this Ephrathite man from Bethlehem in Judah, and his name was Jesse. And eight sons were for him. And the man was old in the days of Saul, coming among men.
\v 13 And the oldest three of the sons of Jesse had gone, they went after Saul to the battle. And the names of the three of his sons who went into the battle were Eliab the firstborn and his second Abinadab and the third Shammah.

\v 19 Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel are in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.”

\v 21 And Israel and the Philistines arranged, battle line to meet battle line.

\v 22 And David left the equipment from on him on the hand of one who keeps the equipment, and he ran to the battle line. And he came and asked his brothers with respect to well-being.

\ts\*
\v 24 And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, they fled from his face and feared greatly.
\v 25 And the men of Israel said, “Have you seen this man who is coming up? Surely he is coming up to taunt Israel! And it will happen that the king will make rich with great wealth the man who strikes him down, and he will give his daughter to him, and he will make the house of his father free in Israel.”

\ts\*
\v 26 And David said to the men who were standing with him, saying, “What will be done for the man who strikes down this Philistine and removes the disgrace from on Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should taunt the ranks of the living God?”
\v 27 And the people said to him like this word, saying, “Thus it will be done for the man who strikes him down.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 28 And Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men. And the nose of Eliab burned against David, and he said, “Why is this—you came down? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I myself know your presumtuousness and the evil of your heart, for you have come down in order to see the battle!”
\v 29 And David said, “What have I done now? Was it not a word?”
\v 30 And he turned around from beside him toward the front of another and spoke like this word. And the people returned a word to him like the first word.

\ts\*

\v 31 And they heard the words that David spoke. And they told before the face of Saul, and he took him.

\v 33 And Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him. For you are a boy, but he a man of war from his youth.”

\ts\*
\v 34 And David said to Saul, “Your servant has been tending for his father among the flock. And the lion or the bear has come and has carried a sheep from the flock.
\v 35 And I have gone out after it and struck it and rescued from its mouth. If it rose against me, then I would grasp its jaw and strike it down and put it to death.
\v 36 Your servant has struck down both the lion and the bear. And this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, for he has taunted the ranks of the living God.”

\ts\*
\v 37 And David said, “Yahweh who has rescued me from the hand of the lion and from the hand of the bear, he will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine.” And Saul said to David, “Go, and Yahweh be with you.”
\v 38 And Saul clothed David with his garments and put a helmet of bronze on his head. And he clothed him with body armor.

\ts\*
\v 39 And David strapped on his sword over his garments and he undertook to walk because he had not trained. And David said to Saul, “I am not able to walk with these, for I have not trained.” And David removed them from on him.
\v 40 And he took his staff in his hand and chose for himself five smooth stones from the wadi, and he put them in the bag of the shepherds that belonged to him, even in the pouch, and his sling was in his hand. And he came near to the Philistine.

\v 41 And the Philistine came, coming on and near to David. And the man who carried the shield was before his face.

\v 43 And the Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you are coming to me with staves?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
\v 44 And the Philistine said to David, “Come to me, and let me give your flesh to the bird of the heavens and to the beast of the field.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 45 And David said to the Philistine, “You are coming to me with sword and with spear and with javelin. But I am coming to you in the name of Yahweh of hosts, the God of the ranks of Israel, whom you have taunted.
\v 46 This day Yahweh will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and remove your head from on you. And this day I will give the corpse of the army of the Philistines to the bird of the heavens and to the living thing of the earth. And all the earth will know that there is a God for Israel.

\v 47 And all this assembly will know that Yahweh does not save by sword or by spear. For the battle belongs to Yahweh, and he will give you into our hand.”

\v 48 And it happened when the Philistine rose and went and came near to meet David, that David hurried and ran to the battle line to meet the Philistine.
\v 49 And David sent his hand into his bag, and took a stone from there, and slung. And it struck the Philistine on his forehead. And the stone sank into his forehead and he fell on his face to the ground.

\ts\*

\v 50 And David was stronger than the Philistine with the sling and with the stone. And he struck down the Philistine and put him to death. (Now there was no sword in the hand of David.)
\v 51 And David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it from its sheath and put him to death and cut off his head with it. And the Philistines saw that their strong man was dead and they fled.

\ts\*
\v 52 And the men of Israel and Judah rose and they shouted and pursued the Philistines as far as your coming to the valley and as far as the gates of Ekron. And the pierced ones of the Philistines fell on the way of Shaaraim and as far as Gath and as far as Ekron.

\v 55 Now as soon as Saul saw David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner the commander of the army, “This boy is the son of whom, Abner?” And Abner said, “As your self is alive, king, if I know!”
\v 56 And the king said, “You ask the son of whom is this boy.”

\ts\*
\v 57 And as soon as David returned from striking down the Philistine, then Abner took him and brought him before the face of Saul. And the head of the Philistine was in his hand.

\v 10 And it happened from the next day that an evil spirit of God rushed on Saul and he prophesied in the midst of the house. And David was playing by his hand, as day by day. And the spear was in the hand of Saul.

\ts\*
\v 22 And Saul commanded his servants, “Speak to David in secrecy, saying, ‘Behold, the king delights in you and all his servants love you. And now, become a son-in-law of the king.’”

\v 24 And the servants of Saul told him, saying, “Like these words David spoke.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 25 And Saul said, “Thus you shall say to David, ‘There is no desire of the king for the bride price, except for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged on the enemies of the king.’” (Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.)
\v 26 And his servants told David these words, and the word was right in the eyes of David, to become son-in-law of the king. And the days were not fulfilled.

\v 2 And he said to him, “Far from it! You will not die. Behold, my father does not do a great thing or a small thing and not uncover my ear. And why would my father hide this thing from me? There is not this!”

\ts\*
\v 3 And David swore again and said, “Your father surely knows that I have found favor in your eyes. And he said, ‘Do not let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved.’ But indeed, as Yahweh is alive, and as your soul is alive, surely between me and death is like a step!”
\v 4 And Jonathan said to David, “Whatever your self says, I will do for you.”

\v 5 And David said to Jonathan, “Behold, the new moon is tomorrow, and surely I should sit with the king to eat. But you shall send me away and I will hide myself in the field until the third evening.
\v 6 If your father misses me at all, then you shall say, ‘David earnestly asked from me to run to Bethlehem, his city, for the sacrifice of the days is there for all the clan.’
\v 7 If thus he says, ‘Good,’ peace is for your servant. But if it burns intensely for him, know that the evil is completed from with him.
\v 8 And you shall do covenant faithfulness with your servant. For you have brought your servant into a covenant of Yahweh with you. But if there is iniquity in me, put me to death yourself. And why should you bring me as far as your father?”

\ts\*
\v 9 And Jonathan said, “Far be it for you! For if I ever know that the evil has been completed from with my father to come on you, then will I not tell it to you?”
\v 10 And David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me if what your father answers you is harsh?”
\v 11 And Jonathan said to David, “Come and let us go out to the field.” And the two of them went out to the field.

\v 12 And Jonathan said to David, “By Yahweh the God of Israel, surely I will sound out my father around this time tomorrow, or the third. If behold, good is to David, then will I not then send to you and uncover your ear?
\v 13 Thus may Yahweh do to Jonathan and thus may he add if the evil on you is good to my father and I do not uncover your ear and send you away, so you may go in peace! And may Yahweh be with you just as he was with my father.

\v 17 And Jonathan caused David to swear again because he loved him. For he loved him like the loving of his self.

\p
\v 18 And Jonathan said to him, “Tomorrow is the new moon. And you will be missed because your seat will be missing.
\v 19 And the third day you shall go down greatly and come to the place there where you hid yourself on the day of the deed. And you shall stay beside the stone Ezel.

\ts\*
\v 20 And as for me, I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as sending forth for me to a target.
\v 21 And behold, I will send the boy, ‘Go find the arrows.’ If I say clearly to the boy, ‘Behold, the arrows are on this side from you; take them,’ then come; for peace is for you and there is no matter, as Yahweh is alive.

\v 22 But if I say thus to the boy, ‘Behold, the arrows are beyond from you,’ go, for Yahweh has sent you away.

\v 24 And David hid himself in the field. And it was the new moon, and the king sat at the food to eat.

\v 26 And Saul did not speak anything on that day, for he said, “It is an accident. He is not clean, surely not clean.”
\v 27 And it happened on the next day of the new moon, the second, that the place of David was missing. And Saul said to Jonathan his son, “Why has the son of Jesse not come to the food both yesterday and today?”

\ts\*
\v 28 And Jonathan answered Saul, “David earnestly asked from with me as far as Bethlehem.
\v 29 And he said, ‘Please send me away. For the sacrifice of our clan is in the city, and he, my brother, has commanded me. And now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me slip away and let me see my brothers.’ Therefore he has not come to the table of the king.”

\v 30 And the nose of Saul burned against Jonathan, and he said to him, “Son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Do I not know that you are choosing the son of Jesse to your shame, and to the shame of the nakedness of your mother?
\v 31 For all the days that the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you and your kingdom will not be established. And now, send and take him to me, for he is a son of death.”

\ts\*
\v 32 And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and he said to him, “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?”
\v 33 And Saul hurled the spear at him to strike him down. And Jonathan knew that it was completed from with his father to put David to death.
\v 34 And Jonathan rose from with the table with a burning nose. And he did not eat food on the second day of the new moon, for he was grieved for David, because his father had dishonored him.

\v 35 And it happened in the morning, that Jonathan went out to the field to the appointment with David. And a small boy was with him.

\v 38 And Jonathan called after the boy, “Quickly hurry! Do not stay!” And the boy of Jonathan picked up the arrows and came to his master.

\v 2 And David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has commanded me with a matter and has said to me, ‘Do not let a man know anything about the matter which I am sending you, and which I have commanded you.’ And I have caused the young men to know about a certain place, a certain one.

\ts\*
\v 3 And now what is there under your hand? Give five bread loaves into my hand, or the found thing.”
\v 4 And the priest answered David and said, “There is no common bread toward under my hand. But there is the holy bread, if the young men have kept themselves only from women.”

\ts\*
\v 5 And David answered the priest and said to him, “Surely a woman has been kept away with respect to us as yesterday and three days ago, as whenever I have gone out. And the vessels of the men have been holy, even though it was a common journey. And how much more today will it be holy with the vessels!”
\v 6 And the priest gave to him the holy thing. For bread was not there except the bread of the face, which was removed from before the face of Yahweh, in order to put hot bread on the day it was taken away.

\v 7 Now a man from the servants of Saul was there on that day, he was detained before the face of Yahweh. And his name was Doeg the Edomite, a powerful one of the herders who were for Saul.

\v 8 And David said to Ahimelech, “Now is there not here under your hand a spear or sword? For both my sword and my weapons I did not take in my hand, because the matter of the king was urgent.”
\v 9 And the priest said, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you struck down in the valley of Elah, behold, it is wrapped in the cloak behind the ephod. If you want to take it for yourself, take, for there is no other except it in this place.” And David said, “There is none like it. Give it to me.”

\v 8 For all of you have conspired against me! And there was no uncovering my ear when my son cut with the son of Jesse. And there was no grieving from you for me or uncovering my ear that my son has raised up my servant against me to lie in ambush as this day.”

\v 24 And she fell on his feet and said, “On me myself, my master, be the iniquity. Please let your female servant speak in your ears, and hear the words of your female servant.

\ts\*
\v 25 Please do not let my master set his heart against this man of worthlessness, against Nabal, for as his name is, so he is. Nabal is his name, and senselessness is with him. But I your female servant did not see the young men of my master, whom you sent.
\v 26 And now, my master, as Yahweh is alive, and as your spirit is alive, it is Yahweh who has witheld you from entering into bloodshed and your hand saving for yourself. And now may your enemies and the ones who seek evil against my master be like Nabal.

\ts\*
\v 27 And now let this blessing that your female servant has brought to my master be given to the young men, the ones going about at the feet of my master.
\v 28 Please lift up the transgression of your female servant! For Yahweh will certainly make my master a sure house, because my master is fighting the battles of Yahweh. And evil will not be found in you from your days.

\ts\*
\v 29 If a man rises up to pursue you and to seek your life, then the life of my master will be bound in the bundle of the living ones by Yahweh your God. And he will sling away the life of your enemies in the midst of the palm of the sling.
\v 30 And it will happen that when Yahweh does for my master according to all the good that he spoke concerning you, and has appointed you for a ruler over Israel,
\v 31 then this will not become an obstacle for you or a stumbling block of heart for my master, or as the pouring out of blood without cause, or as my master saving himself. And Yahweh will do good for my master, and you will remember your female servant.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 32 And David said to Abigail, “May Yahweh, the God of Israel, be blessed, who sent you this day to meet me.
\v 33 And blessed be your discernment and blessed be you, who have witheld me this day from entering into bloodshed and my hand saving for myself!

\ts\*
\v 34 But indeed, as Yahweh is alive, the God of Israel is he who has witheld me from doing evil to you. For if you had not hurried and come to meet me, surely there would not have been left over for Nabal until the light of the morning one who urinates against a wall.”
\v 35 And David took from her hand what she had brought to him. And to her he said, “Go up in peace to your house. See, I have listened to your voice and have lifted up your face.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 36 And Abigail came to Nabal, and behold, for him was a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And the heart of Nabal was good with him and he was drunk to abundance. And she did not tell him a thing small or great until the light of the morning.
\v 37 And it happened in the morning, when the wine had gone out from Nabal, that his wife told him these things. And his heart died in his inner part and he became a stone.
\v 38 And it was about ten days then Yahweh struck Nabal and he died.

\ts\*
\p
\v 39 And David heard that Nabal had died, and he said, “Blessed be Yahweh, who has argued the case of my reproach from the hand of Nabal and has witheld his servant from evil. And Yahweh has returned the evil of Nabal on his head.” And David sent and spoke with Abigail, to take her for himself for a wife.
\v 40 And the servants of David came to Abigail at the Carmel. And they spoke to her, saying, “David has sent us to you to take you for him for a wife.”

\ts\*
\v 41 And she rose and bowed down, nostrils to the earth, and she said, “Behold, your female servant is as a slave woman for washing the feet of the servants of my master.”
\v 42 And Abigail hurried and rose and rode on the donkey, and five of her servant girls were going to her feet. And she went behind the messengers of David and became a wife for him.

\ts\*
\v 43 And David took Ahinoam from Jezreel. And the two of them both became wives for him.

\p
\v 44 Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, the wife of David, to Paltiel the son of Laish, who was from Gallim.

\ts\*


\c 26
\p
\v 1 And the Ziphites came to Saul at the Gibeah, saying, “Is not David hiding himself in the hill of the Hakilah, on the face of the Jeshimon?”
\v 2 And Saul rose and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, and with him were 3, 000 men, chosen ones of Israel, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.

\ts\*
\v 3 And Saul camped in the hill of the Hakilah, which is on the face of the Jeshimon, by the road. But David was staying in the wilderness and he saw that Saul was coming after him to the wilderness.
\v 4 And David sent spies and he knew that Saul had certainly come.
\v 5 And David rose and came to the place there where Saul had camped. And David saw the place there where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army. And Saul lay in the entrenchment, and the people were camped around him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 And David answered and said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, the brother of Joab, saying, “Who will go down with me to Saul, to the camp?” And Abishai said, “I! I will go down with you.”
\v 7 And David and Abishai came to the people at night. And behold, Saul lie asleep in the entrenchment, and his spear was pressed into the ground at the place of his head. And Abner and the people were lying around him.
\v 8 And Abishai said to David, “Today God has delivered your enemy into your hand. And now please let me strike him with the spear even into the earth one time. And I will not do it again to him.”

\ts\*
\v 9 And David said to Abishai, “Do not destroy him. For who has stretched out his hand against the anointed one of Yahweh and been innocent?”
\v 10 And David said, “As Yahweh is alive, surely Yahweh will strike him, or his day will come and he will die, or he will go down into the battle and be swept away.

\ts\*
\v 11 Far be it for me from Yahweh to stretch out my hand against the anointed one of Yahweh. And now, please take the spear that is at the place of his head and the jug of water, and let us go for ourselves.”
\v 12 And David took the spear and the jug of water from the place of the head of Saul, and they went for themselves. And there was no one who saw, and there was no one who knew, and there was no one who awoke, for all of them were sleeping, because a deep sleep of Yahweh had fallen on them.

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And David passed over to the other side and stood on the head of the mountain from a distance. Great was the distance between them.
\v 14 And David called out to the people and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, “Will you not answer, Abner?” And Abner answered and said, “Who are you who calls out to the king?”

\ts\*
\v 15 And David said to Abner, “Are you not a man? And who is like you in Israel? But why did you not watch over your master the king? For one of the people came to destroy the king your master.
\v 16 This thing that you have done is not good. As Yahweh is alive, surely sons of death are you who did not watch over your master, over the anointed one of Yahweh. And now see, where is the spear of the king and the jar of water that was at the place of his head?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 17 And Saul recognized the voice of David and said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” And David said, “It is my voice, my master the king.”
\v 18 And he said, “Why is my master pursuing after his servant? For what have I done? And what evil is in my hand?

\ts\*
\v 19 And now, please hear, my master the king, the words of his servant. If Yahweh has incited you against me, may he smell an offering; but if the sons of the man, cursed be them before the face of Yahweh. For they have today driven me out from joining oneself with the inheritance of Yahweh, saying, ‘Go serve other gods.’
\v 20 And now, do not let my blood fall to the earth from in front of the face of Yahweh. For the king of Israel has come out to seek one flea just as one pursues the partridge in the mountains.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 And Saul said, “I have sinned! Return, my son David! For I will not do evil to you again, because my life was precious in your eyes this day. Behold, I have acted foolishly and have gone very much astray!”
\v 22 And David answered and said, “Behold, the spear of the king! And let one of the young men pass over and take it.
\v 23 And may Yahweh return to the man his righteousness and his faithfulness; because Yahweh gave you into a hand today, but I was not willing to stretch out my hand against the anointed one of Yahweh.

\ts\*
\v 24 And behold, just as your life was great in my eyes this day, so may my life be great in the eyes of Yahweh, and may he rescue me from all distress.”
\v 25 And Saul said to David, “Blessed be you, my son David! You will certainly both do and also you will certainly be able.” And David went to his way, and Saul returned to his place.

\ts\*


\c 27
\p
\v 1 And David said to his heart, “Now I will be swept away one day by the hand of Saul. There is no good thing for me, but I will certainly slip away to the land of the Philistines. And Saul will despair of me, of seeking me again in all the territory of Israel, and I will slip away from his hand.”
\v 2 And David rose and passed over, he and 600 men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maok, the king of Gath.
\v 3 And David dwelled with Achish in Gath, he and his men, a man and his house, David and the two of his wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelite woman and Abigail the Carmelite woman, the wife of Nabal.
\v 4 And it was told to Saul that David had fled to Gath. And he did not again seek him more.

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And David said to Achish, “If I have found favor in your eyes, let them give to me a place in one of the cities of the field, and I may dwell there. And why should your servant dwell in the city of the kingship with you?”
\v 6 And on that day Achish gave to him Ziklag. Therefore Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah until this day.

\ts\*
\p
\v 7 And the number of the days that David dwelled in the field of the Philistines was days and four months.
\v 8 And David and his men went up and raided against the Geshurites and the Girzites and the Amalekites. For they were dwelling in the land, which is from ancient times, as you go to Shur, and as far as the land of Egypt.\f + \ft Instead of \fqa the Girzites\fqa* which is found in some ancient Hebrew manuscripts, some modern versions have \fqa the Gizrites\fqa* which is found in the margin of some Hebrew manuscripts.\f*
\v 9 And David struck the land and did not let a man or a woman live. And he took sheep and cattle and donkeys and camels and garments. And he returned and came to Achish.

\ts\*
\v 10 And Achish said, “Against whom did you raid today?” And David said, “Against the south of Judah and against the south of the Jerahmeelite and against the south of the Kenite.”
\v 11 Now David did not let a man or a woman live to bring to Gath, saying, “Lest they tell about us, saying, ‘Thus did David.’” And thus was his custom all the days that he dwelled in the field of the Philistines.
\v 12 And Achish trusted in David, saying, “He certainly stinks among his people in Israel, and he will become an eternal servant for me.”

\ts\*


\c 28
\p
\v 1 And it happened in those days that the Philistines gathered their camps for the war to fight with Israel. And Achish said to David, “You certainly know that you will go out with me in the camp, you and your men.”
\v 2 And David said to Achish, “Therefore, you yourself will know what your servant can do.” And Achish said to David, “Therefore, I will appoint you the keeper of my head all the days.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 3 Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and had buried him in the Ramah, even in his city. And Saul had removed the necromancers and the ones with familiar spirits from the land.
\v 4 And the Philistines gathered and came and camped at Shunem. And Saul gathered all Israel, and they camped at the Gilboa.

\ts\*
\v 5 And Saul saw the camp of the Philistines. And he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.
\v 6 And Saul inquired of Yahweh, but Yahweh did not answer him—neither by the dreams, nor by the Urim, nor by the prophets.
\v 7 And Saul said to his servants, “Seek for me a woman of a mistress of necromancy, so I may go to her and inquire of her.” And his servants said to him, “Behold, a woman of a mistress of necromancy is in Endor.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And Saul disguised himself, and put on other clothes, and went, he and two of the men with him. And they came to the woman at night. And he said, “Please practice divination for me with a spirit of the dead, and bring up for me whom I say to you.”
\v 9 And the woman said to him, “Behold, you yourself know what Saul has done, that he has cut off the necromancers and the ones with a familiar spirit from the land. And why are you setting a trap against my life, to put me to death?”
\v 10 And Saul swore to her by Yahweh, saying, “As Yahweh is alive, no punishment will meet you by this matter.”

\ts\*
\v 11 And the woman said, “Whom will I bring up for you?” And he said, “Bring up Samuel for me.”
\v 12 And the woman saw Samuel and cried out with a loud voice. And the woman said to Saul, saying, “Why did you deceive me? And you are Saul!”

\ts\*
\v 13 And the king said to her, “Do not be afraid, but what did you see?” And the woman said to Saul, “I saw gods going up from the earth.”
\v 14 And he said to her, “What is his appearance?” And she said, “An old man is coming up and he is wrapped in a robe.” And Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed, nostrils to the ground, and he bowed down.

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 And Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” And Saul said, “It is very narrow for me, and the Philistines are about to fight against me. And God has turned aside from on me and does not answer me anymore, neither by the hand of the prophets, nor by the dreams, so I have called to you, to cause me to know what I will do.”

\p
\v 16 And Samuel said, “And why do you ask me while Yahweh has turned aside from on you and has become your enemy?
\v 17 And Yahweh has done for himself just as he spoke by my hand. And Yahweh has torn the kingdom from your hand and has given it to your companion, to David.

\ts\*
\v 18 Because you did not listen to the voice of Yahweh and did not perform the burning of his nose against Amalek, therefore Yahweh has done this thing to you this day.
\v 19 And Yahweh will also give Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. Yahweh will also give the camp of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 20 And Saul immediately fell with the fullness of his height to the ground and was very afraid from the words of Samuel. Also strength was not in him, for he had not eaten bread all the day and all the night.
\v 21 And the woman came to Saul and saw that he was very terrified, And she said to him, “Behold, your female servant has listened to your voice and I have put my life in my palm and have heard the words that you have spoken to me.

\ts\*
\v 22 And now, please listen, even you, to the voice of your female servant, and let me set a bit of bread before your face and eat. And strength will be in you when you go in the way.”
\v 23 And he refused and said, “I will not eat.” But his servants and also the woman, urged him, and he listened to their voice. And he rose from the ground and sat on the bed.

\ts\*
\v 24 Now a calf of the stall belonged to the woman in the house, and she hurried and sacrificed it. And she took flour and kneaded and baked it to unleavened bread.
\v 25 And she brought it near before the face of Saul and before the face of his servants, and they ate. And they rose and went in that night.

\ts\*


\c 29
\p
\v 1 And the Philistines gathered all their camp at Aphek. And Israel was camping at the spring that is in Jezreel.
\v 2 And the rulers of the Philistines were passing over by hundreds and by thousands. And David and his men were passing over in the rear with Achish.
\v 3 And the commanders of the Philistines said, “What are these Hebrews?” And Achish said to the commanders of the Philistines, “Is this not David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me these days or these years, and I have not found anything in him from the day of his falling until this day?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 And the commanders of the Philistines were furious against him. And the commanders of the Philistines said to him, “Make the man return, that he may return to his place there where you assigned him. And he will not go down with us in the battle, and he will not become an adversary for us in the battle. And by what could this one make himself acceptable to his master? Is it not by the heads of these men?
\v 5 Is this not David of whom they sang in the dances, saying,
\q ‘Saul has struck down his thousands,
\q and David his ten thousands’?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 And Achish called to David and said to him, “As Yahweh is alive, surely you are upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the camp is good in my eyes, for I have not found evil in you from the day of your coming to me until this day. But in the eyes of the rulers you are not good.
\v 7 And now return and go in peace, so you do not do evil in the eyes of the rulers of the Philistines.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And David said to Achish, “But what have I done? And what have you found in your servant from the day when I was before your face until this day, that I may not come and fight against the enemies of my master the king?”
\v 9 And Achish answered and said to David, “I know that you are good in my eyes like a messenger of God. Nevertheless, the commanders of the Philistines have said, ‘He must not go up with us in the battle.’

\ts\*
\v 10 And now rise early in the morning with the servants of your master who came with you. And you shall rise early in the morning with light for you and go.”
\v 11 And David rose early, he and his men, to go in the morning, to return to the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.

\ts\*


\c 30
\p
\v 1 And it happened, when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had raided against the Negev and against Ziklag. And they had struck Ziklag and had burned it with fire.
\v 2 And they had taken captive the women who were in it, from small and as far as great. They had not put a man to death, but had led them away and went to their way.

\ts\*
\v 3 And David and his men came to the city, and behold, it was burned with fire! And their wives and their sons and their daughters had been taken captive.
\v 4 And David and the people who were with him lifted up their voices and wept until there was no strength in them to weep.

\ts\*
\v 5 And the two of the wives of David had been taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelite woman and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
\v 6 And it was very narrow for David, for the people said to stone him, for the spirit of all the people was bitter, a man for his sons and for his daughters. And David strengthened himself in Yahweh, his God.

\ts\*
\p
\v 7 And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Please bring near to me the ephod.” And Abiathar brought near to David the ephod.
\v 8 And David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “If I pursue after this troop, will I overtake it?” And he said to him, “Pursue, for you will certainly overtake and you will certainly rescue.”

\ts\*
\v 9 And David went, he and the 600 men who were with him, and they came as far as the wadi of the Besor. And the ones who were left behind stayed.
\v 10 And David pursued, he and 400 men. And 200 men stayed, who were too exhausted to pass over the wadi of the Besor.

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 And they found an Egyptian man in the field and took him to David. And they gave to him bread, and he ate. And they caused him to drink water.
\v 12 And they gave to him a slice of a fig cake and two raisin clusters, and he ate and his spirit returned to him. For he had not eaten bread and had not drunk water three days and three nights.

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And David said to him, “To whom do you belong? And where are you from?” And he said, “I am an Egyptian young man, a slave of a man of the Amalekite. And my master left me because three days ago I became sick.
\v 14 We raided the Negev of the Kerethites, and against what belongs to Judah, and against the Negev of Caleb. And we burned Ziklag with fire.”
\v 15 And David said to him, “Will you bring me down to this troop?” And he said, “Swear to me by God that you will not put me to death and not deliver me into the hand of my master, and I will bring you down to this troop.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 16 And he brought him down, and behold, they were spread out over the face of all the land, eating and drinking and celebrating because of all the great spoil that they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.
\v 17 And David struck them down from the twilight and until the evening of their next day. And a man did not slip away from them except for 400 men, young men who rode on the camels and fled.

\ts\*
\v 18 And David rescued all that Amalek had taken. And David rescued the two of his wives.
\v 19 And it was not missing for them from small and as far as great and as far as sons and daughters and from spoil and as far as all that they had taken for themselves. David brought back everything.
\v 20 And David took all the sheep and the cattle. They drove before the face of that livestock, and said, “This is the spoil of David.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 And David came to the 200 men who had been too exhausted to go behind David, and they had caused them to stay at the wadi of the Besor. And they went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him. And David came near the people and asked them with respect to well-being.
\v 22 And all the evil and worthless men from the men who had gone with David answered and said, “Because they did not go with us, we will not give to them from the spoil that we have rescued, except a man his wife and his sons, that they may lead away and go.”

\ts\*
\v 23 And David said, “You shall not do so, my brothers, with what Yahweh has given to us. And he has kept us and given into our hand the troop who came against us.
\v 24 And who will listen to you with respect to this matter? For as is the portion of the one who went down in the battle, so shall be the portion of the one who stayed with the things. They shall be apportioned together.”
\v 25 And it happened from that day and beyond, that he set it for a statute and for a custom for Israel, until this day.

\ts\*
\p
\v 26 And David came to Ziklag and sent some of the spoil to the elders of Judah, to his companions, saying, “Behold, a blessing for you: some of the spoil of the enemies of Yahweh.”
\v 27 It was for he who was in Bethel and for he who was in Ramoth of the South and for he who was in Jattir
\v 28 and for he who was in Aroer and for he who was in Siphmoth and for he who was in Eshtemoa

\ts\*
\v 29 and for he who was in Rakal and for he who was in the cities of the Jerahmeelite and for he who was in the cities of the Kenite
\v 30 and for he who was in Hormah and for he who was in Bor Ashan and for he who was in Athak
\v 31 and for he who was in Hebron and for all the places there where David walked about, he and his men.

\v 1 Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel. And the men of Israel fled from before the face of the Philistines and they fell pierced on Mount Gilboa.
\v 2 And the Philistines stuck close to Saul and his sons. And the Philistines struck down Jonathan and Abinadab and Malki-Shua, the sons of Saul.
\v 3 And the battle was heavy against Saul and the archers, the men with the bow, found him. And he writhed in pain greatly because of the archers.

\ts\*
\v 4 And Saul said to the one who carried his equipment, “Draw out your sword and pierce me through with it, lest these uncircumcised ones come and pierce me through and deal severely with me.” But the one who carried his equipment was not willing, for he was very afraid. And Saul took the sword and fell on it.
\v 5 And the one who carried his equipment saw that Saul had died. And he fell, he also, on his sword and died with him.

\ts\*
\v 6 And Saul died and the three of his sons and the one who carried his equipment, even all his men together on that day.
\v 7 And the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley and who were on the other side of the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled, and that Saul and his sons had died. And they left their cities and fled. And the Philistines came and dwelled in them.

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And it happened from the next day, that the Philistines came to strip the pierced ones. And they found Saul and the three of his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
\v 9 And they cut off his head and stripped off his equipment. And they sent into the land of the Philistines all around to bring news to the house of their idols and to the people.

\ts\*
\v 10 And they put his equipment in the house of the Ashtoreths. And they thrust his corpse on the wall of Beth Shan.
\v 11 And those who dwelled in Jabesh Gilead heard about it, what the Philistines had done to Saul.

\ts\*
\v 12 And all the men of strength rose and went all the night and took the corpse of Saul and the corpses of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan. And they went to Jabesh and burned them there.
\v 13 And they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh. And they fasted seven days.
