\v 1 {These are} the wise sayings said by Solomon. {He was} David’s son and Israel’s king.
\q1 \v 2 {These wise sayings are} for knowing what is wise and instructive. 
\q2 {They are} for understanding insightful things that people say.
\q1 \v 3 {These wise sayings are} for instructing someone about what is insightful,
\q2 righteous, just, and honest.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 4 {They are} for making naive people prudent,
\q2 and {for making} young people knowledgeable and discreet.
\q1 \v 5 (Let wise people listen {to these wise sayings} and learn more.
\q2 Indeed, {let these sayings} guide understanding people so that they know what to do.)
\q1 \v 6 {These wise sayings are} for understanding wise sayings and parables.
\q2 {Indeed, they are for understanding} what wise people say and the riddles they tell.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 7 In order to become knowledgeable, a person must begin by deeply respecting Yahweh.
\q2 {But} foolish people detest what is wise or instructive.

\q1 \v 8 My child, listen carefully to what I, your father, am teaching you.
\q2 Indeed, obey the rules that your mother has commanded.
\q1 \v 9 {Obey your parents’ teaching} because then {people will admire and respect you;} it will be as if those teachings were an attractive wreath on your head,
\q2 or beautiful necklaces around your neck.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 10 My child, if sinful people tempt you {to sin with them},
\q2 refuse {to do so}.
\q1 \v 11 Those sinful people may say, “Join us!
\q2 We will hide and wait in order to kill someone {who walks by}.
\q2 Indeed, we will hide ourselves in order to suddenly attack an innocent person for no good reason.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 12 We will kill living people completely, as if we were their grave.
\q2 {Yes, we will kill} healthy people, as if they could not escape dying.
\q1 \v 13 We will discover many valuable treasures!
\q2 We will fill our houses with what we steal!
\q1 \v 14 Join our gang!
\q2 We will share all the loot between us.”

\ts\*
\q1 \v 15 My child, do not associate with those sinful people!
\q2 Prevent yourself from doing the things that they do!
\q1 \v 16 {Avoid those sinners} because they are eager to do wicked things.
\q2 They even rush to murder people.
\q1 \v 17 It is useless {for a hunter} to put out a net {to trap a bird}
\q2 while the bird is watching {because the bird will avoid the net}.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 18 However, {these sinful people are more foolish than birds.} They hide in wait, but they kill themselves. 
\q2 Indeed, they hide so that they can suddenly attack, but they themselves die.
\q1 \v 19 That is what happens to anyone who gains wealth in an unjust manner.
\q2 What they gained unjustly will kill them.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 20 Imagine that everything that is wise is a woman who calls out {to everyone} in public.
\q2 Imagine that this woman shouts {to people} in crowded places.
\q1 \v 21 Imagine that she calls out {to people} at the place where busy streets intersect.
\q2 Imagine that she speaks her {wise} words at the {crowded} entrance of the city gates.

\q1 \v 22 She says, “You naive people have loved being naive for too long!
\q2 You people who ridicule {others} have enjoyed ridiculing {others} to benefit yourselves for too long!
\q2 You foolish people have hated what you should know for too long!
\ts\*
\q1 \v 23 Turn around {and listen} to me when I correct you!
\q2 Listen! I will tell you all that I am thinking.
\q2 Indeed, I will help you to understand what I have to say to you.
\q1 \v 24 I called out {to you}, but you refused {to listen}.
\q2 Indeed, I invited you to come to me,
\q2 but no one paid any attention {to me}.
\q1 \v 25 You ignored everything that I advised you to do.
\q2 Indeed, you rejected what I said to correct you.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 26 Therefore, as for me, I will laugh at you when disastrous things happen to you.
\q2 Indeed, I will ridicule you when you are terrified.
\q1 \v 27 {Yes,} when you are terrified as if a violent storm has arrived,
\q2 {when} disastrous things happen to you violently,
\q2 {and} when you become distressed and anguished{, I will ridicule you}!
\ts\*
\q1 \v 28 At that time, those foolish people will cry out to me {to help them},
\q2 but I will not reply {to them}.
\q2 Indeed, they will desperately look for me,
\q2 but they will not be able to find me.

\q1 \v 29 {Those foolish people will not find me} because they refuse to learn.
\q2 Also, they have decided not to respect Yahweh.
\q1 \v 30 Those foolish people rejected what I advised them to do.
\q2 Indeed, they detested everything I said to correct them.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 31 Those foolish people will suffer rightly for what they have done.
\q2 Indeed, they will suffer fully for what they have planned.
\q1 \v 32 Ultimately, naive people will die because they refuse {to be wise}.
\q2 Indeed, being complacent will destroy foolish people.
\q1 \v 33 By contrast, people who listen attentively to what I say will live safely.
\q2 They will not fear that something evil might happen to them.”

\ts\*

\c 2
\q1 
\v 1 My child, accept what I say.
\q2 Consider what I command {you} to be precious.
\q1 \v 2 {Do this by} listening attentively to what is wise,
\q2 {and by} thinking seriously about what you should understand.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 3 Yes, cry out to learn what you should understand.
\q2 Cry loudly to learn what you should perceive!
\q1 \v 4 Try to learn what is wise, like you would try to find silver.
\q2 Indeed, look eagerly for it, like you would look for a treasure that someone has hidden.
\q1 \v 5 {If you do those things,} then you will understand how to reverently fear Yahweh.
\q2 You will even succeed in knowing God.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 6 {This is} because Yahweh provides people with what is wise.
\q2 He tells them what they should know and understand.
\q1 \v 7 He gives what is truly wise to upright people.
\q2 He protects people who behave honestly.
\q1 \v 8 {He does these things} in order to guard those people who live justly.
\q2 Indeed, he keeps safe those people who are faithful to him.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 9 {If you listen to me,} then you will understand what is righteous, just, and honest,
\q2 {even} the best way to behave.
\q1 \v 10 {This is because} you will truly know what is wise,
\q2 and knowing what you should know will please you.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 11 Being discreet will make you safe.
\q2 Indeed, being insightful will make you secure.
\q1 \v 12 {Being like this will protect you} in order to save you from people who behave wickedly
\q2 {and save you} from people who speak perversely.
\q1 \v 13 Those people refuse to behave righteously in order to behave wickedly.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 14 They gladly do evil things.
\q2 They enjoy evil and perverse acts.
\q1 \v 15 They behave deceptively.
\q2 Indeed, they act deviously.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 16 {Being discreet and insightful will protect you also} in order to save you from adulterous women,
\q2 {and to save you} from immoral women who speak {to you} seductively.
\q1 \v 17 Those women left the husbands they married when they were young.
\q2 They even forgot what they had promised to God {when they married}.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 18 {Being discreet and insightful will rescue you} because {going to} such a woman’s house will result in you dying.
\q2 Indeed, going with her will result in you going to the place where the spirits of dead people are.

\q1 \v 19 No one who acts adulterously with her will live again.
\q2 They will never become alive again!

\ts\*
\q1 \v 20 Therefore, behave like a good person.
\q2 Indeed, conduct yourself like a righteous person.
\q1 \v 21 Ultimately, people who live uprightly will live in our land,
\q2 Indeed, people whom Yahweh does not blame {for acting wickedly} will stay in this land for a long time.
\q1 \v 22 By contrast, Yahweh will remove people who act wickedly from our land.
\q2 Yahweh will completely remove people who act treacherously from this land!


\ts\*

\c 3
\q1 
\v 1 My child, remember the rules I have taught you!
\q2 Always be mindful to obey what I have commanded you! 
\q1 \v 2 {Do this} because {obeying} what I have commanded you will help you live for a long time with many fulfilling and peaceful years.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 3 Always be faithful and trustworthy.
\q2 Let everyone see {how faithful and trustworthy you are, as if} they were a necklace you are wearing.
\q2 Remember to be faithful and trustworthy at all times.
\q1 \v 4 As a result of doing so, both God and people will approve of you and think well of you.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 5 Trust Yahweh completely,
\q2 and do not rely on what you understand.
\q1 \v 6 Remember Yahweh whenever you do anything.
\q2 As a result {of doing so}, he will show you what you should do.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 7 Do not think that you are wise.
\q2 Instead, reverently fear Yahweh and refuse to do what is evil.
\q1 \v 8 Doing so will make your body healthy.
\q2 Indeed, {doing so} will refresh you.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 9 Revere Yahweh {by giving to him} some of your riches,
\q2 {even by giving to him} some of the first {crops} from everything that you harvest.
\q1 \v 10 {Doing so} will result in your places for storing crops becoming abundantly full {of crops}.
\q2 Even your containers for wine will overflow with fresh wine.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 11 My child, do not refuse to listen when Yahweh corrects you.
\q2 Do not be resentful even when he rebukes you.
\q1 \v 12 {Do not do so} because Yahweh only reproves the people whom he loves.
\q2 He is similar to a father who reproves the child whom he likes.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 13 People who gain what is wise are happy.
\q2 Indeed, people who gain what they should understand {are truly happy}.
\q1 \v 14 {This is} because being wise profits people more than silver {could profit them}.
\q2 Indeed, being wise benefits people more than gold {could benefit them}.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 15 Being wise is more valuable than precious jewels.
\q2 There is nothing you could desire that is worth as much as being wise.
\q1 \v 16 Being wise will help you live for a long time.
\q2
Being wise will help you become wealthy and honorable.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 17 Being wise will make you live pleasantly.
\q2 Indeed, in every way being wise will make you live peacefully.
\q1 \v 18 What is wise is {like} a tree {with fruit} that keeps alive the people who hold on to it,
\q2 People who are consistently wise live happily.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 19 Yahweh made the world by using what is wise.
\q2 He made the sky by using what he understands.
\q1 \v 20 According to what Yahweh understands, water flowed forth from deep {below the earth} and water fell from the clouds {above}.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 21 My child, always remember to do what is prudent and discreet.
\q2 Always be mindful to do those things.
\q1 \v 22 Doing so will help you live for a long time
\q2 and will make you {respectable, as if you had} an attractive necklace around your neck.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 23 Doing so will {also} cause you to live safely.
\q2 You will not even get hurt.
\q1 \v 24 When you lie down {to sleep}, you will not fear anything.
\q2 You will even lie down {to sleep} and sleep peacefully.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 25 Do not worry about something terrible suddenly happening {to you},
\q2 or about {what will happen} when God destroys wicked people.
\q1 \v 26 {Do not worry} because Yahweh will make you confident.
\q2 He will not allow people to harm you.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 27 Do not refrain from giving what is good to people who deserve it
\q2 when you are able to do so.
\q1 \v 28 When you have something {that someone you know needs}, do not tell that person, 
\q2 “Go away and come back later. I will give it to you then.” 

\ts\*
\q1 \v 29 Do not plan to harm anyone, even someone who lives nearby and trusts you.
\q1 \v 30 Do not argue needlessly with someone who has not harmed you.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 31 Do not envy violent people.
\q2 Do not imitate anything they do.
\q1 \v 32 {Do not do so} because Yahweh detests {such} people who act wickedly, 
\q2 but he converses like a friend with people who act uprightly.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 33 Yahweh causes bad things to happen to the families of wicked people,
\q2 but he causes good things to happen to the families of righteous people.
\q1 \v 34 Yahweh is the one who ridicules people who ridicule {others},
\q2 but he approves of people who are humble.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 35 People will honor wise people,
\q2 but will shame foolish people.

\c 4

\q1 \v 1 Children, listen carefully to what I, your father, am teaching you.
\q2 Pay attention in order to learn what you should understand.
\q1 \v 2 {Do this} because what I am teaching you is good.
\q2 {So} remember the rules that I am teaching you.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 3 I was once my father’s boy,
\q2 {and} my mother considered me to be her delicate, only son.
\q1 \v 4 During that time, my father taught me. He told me,
\q2 “Remember what I have told you!
\q2 Do what I have commanded you, so that you will keep on living!
\ts\*
\q1 \v 5 Obtain what is wise and what you should understand!
\q2 Always remember what I have spoken to you!
\q1 \v 6 Remember what is wise, so that it will be like a woman who keeps you safe.
\q2 Love what is wise, so that it will be like a woman who protects you.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 7 Being wise is the most important thing! {So} obtain what is wise!
\q2 {Even if} it costs you everything that you own, obtain what you should understand!
\q1
\v 8 Prize what is wise, so that you will become great.
\q2 People will honor you when you value what is wise.
\q1 \v 9 Being wise {will make you respectable, as if it} put an attractive wreath on your head.
\q2 Indeed, being wise {will make you honorable, as if it} gave you a magnificent crown.”

\ts\*
\q1 \v 10 My child, listen attentively and accept what I say.
\q2 Doing so will increase the number of years that you live.
\q1 \v 11 I instructed you in how to act wisely.
\q2 I directed you in how to act uprightly.
\q1 \v 12 When you do something, nothing will prevent you {from succeeding}.
\q2 Indeed, if you do anything, you will succeed.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 13 Consistently remember the things I have instructed you;
\q2 keep remembering them!
\q2 Always be mindful of them, because they will keep you alive.
\q1 \v 14 Do not do what wicked people do.
\q2 Indeed, do not act like evil people act.
\q1 \v 15 Shun doing what is evil. Do not even consider doing it!
\q2 Refuse to act wickedly and do something else.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 16 {Do not act wickedly} because {it is as if} evil people cannot even sleep unless they do something evil;
\q2 {it is as if} they cannot rest unless they hurt someone.
\q1 \v 17 {Do not act wickedly} because evil people do wicked things as if they were eating food;
\q2 they violently hurt others as if they were drinking wine.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 18 As for righteous people, {they will live wisely and safely} like the light of the sun at dawn.
\q2 {They will live more and more wisely and safely as} the sun shines brighter and brighter until the brightest time of day.
\q1 \v 19 {But} wicked people {live dangerously} like people {who walk} in total darkness.
\q2 {Like people walking in darkness do not know} what they trip over, they do not know {what hurts them}.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 20 My child, pay attention to what I am saying to you!
\q2 Listen carefully to what I say!
\q1 \v 21 Always remember what I say!
\q2 Fully commit yourself to remembering such things!
\ts\*
\q1 \v 22 {Do this} because those who do so will live {for a long time},
\q2 even their whole bodies will be healthy.
\q1 \v 23 Be extremely careful about what you think,
\q2 because what you think will control how you live.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 24 Do not say anything  that deceives people.
\q2 Indeed, never say anything that misleads people.
\q1 \v 25 {Focus on doing what is right, like} someone who is always looking straight ahead.
\q2 Indeed, {act like} someone who is looking straight in front of himself.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 26 Carefully consider what you do.
\q2 As a result {of doing so}, you will succeed in everything that you do.
\q1 \v 27 Do not do anything other than what is right.
\q2 Prevent yourself from doing what is evil.


\ts\*

\c 5
\q1 
\v 1 My son, pay attention to the wise things that I tell you!
\q2 Listen carefully to what I say you should understand!
\q1 \v 2 {Do this} so that you may remain discreet,
\q2 and you may preserve what you know when you speak.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 3 {Do this} because what adulterous women say seems delightful like honey
\q2 and more pleasing than olive oil.
\q1 \v 4 However, being with such a woman will result in you being miserable, as if you had eaten a bitter plant.
\q2 {You will suffer} like a person whom someone has cut with a sharp, double-edged sword.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 5 {Being with such a woman will result in both of you dying} as if she were leading you to where dead people are.
\q2 Indeed, what she does will cause you both to die.
\q1 \v 6 She does not want to do what will cause her to live for a long time.
\q2 She does not realize that she {lives precariously like someone who} is walking on an uneven path.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 7 So now, children, pay attention to what I say!
\q2 Always remember what I have spoken to you!
\q1 \v 8 Stay far away from any adulterous woman!
\q2 Do not even go near the door of the place where such a woman dwells!
\ts\*
\q1 \v 9 If you go to such a woman, people will weaken you,
\q2 and some merciless person will take away {what you have gained in} the best time of your life.
\q1 \v 10 If you go to such a woman, people you do not know will satisfy themselves with {what you gained} when you were strong,
\q2 and some foreign person will fill his house with what you labored to gain.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 11 Then you will groan when you are about to die
\q2 and have worn out your whole body.
\q1 \v 12 Then you will say, “I hated it extremely when people corrected me!
\q2 Indeed, I scorned people when they rebuked me!
\ts\*
\q1 \v 13 I did not obey the people who taught me.
\q2 Indeed, I did not listen carefully to the people who instructed me.
\q1 \v 14 I almost utterly disgraced myself in public.”

\ts\*
\q1 \v 15 {So be like} someone who only drinks water from his own well;
\q2 have sex with your wife only.
\q1 \v 16 {Do not be like} someone who lets his water run out into the streets;
\q2 never have sex with other women!
\q1 \v 17 Only have sex with your own wife!
\q2 Do not have sex with other women!
\ts\*
\q1 \v 18 Be happy with your wife;
\q2 rejoice with the woman whom you married when you were young.
\q \v 19 {She is as beautiful as} a loving deer and {as graceful as} a mountain goat.
\q2 Let how attractive she is always satisfy you.
\q2 Constantly be exhilarated by how she loves you.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 20 My son, you should never be exhilarated by an adulterous woman!
\q2 You should never passionately caress an immoral woman!
\q1 \v 21 {Never do that] because Yahweh fully knows what people do.
\q2 Indeed, he knows everything that people do.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 22 The wicked things that wicked people do are {like} traps that catch them;
\q2 the sinful things they do are {like] ropes that tie them down.
\q1 \v 23 Those wicked people will die because they did not discipline themselves.
\q2 They will do what kills them because they are extremely foolish.


\ts\*

\c 6
\q1 
\v 1 My child, if you guarantee to pay a loan for someone you know,
\q2 {or if} you agree to pay a loan for someone you do not know,
\q1 \v 2 {or if} you have troubled yourself by promising to do something,
\q2 {and} you cannot fulfill what you promised,
\ts\*
\q1 \v 3 then, my child, do this in order to save yourself {from what you have troubled yourself with}:
\q2 humbly go to that person you know and beg him {to cancel what you have promised} because he controls you.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 4 Do not sleep,
\q2 do not even rest {until you go and talk to him}.
\q1 \v 5 Save yourself {immediately},
\q2 as if you were a deer fleeing from a hunter
\q2 or a bird fleeing from a trapper.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 6 You lazy person, go watch ants!
\q2 Consider what ants do so that you can be wise.
\q1 \v 7 Absolutely no one tells ants what to do.
\q1 \v 8 {Nevertheless,} at the right time they store their food {to eat during the winter}.
\q2 Indeed, when people harvest crops, the ants collect what they will {later} eat.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 9 {But} you lazy person, stop sleeping!
\q2 Wake up!
\q1 \v 10 {You say to yourself,} “Let me sleep just a little more!
\q2 Let me lay my hands {across my chest} in order to rest comfortably for a little while longer!”
\q1 \v 11 {Being so lazy} will result in you suddenly becoming poor and needy 
\q2 as if a thief has robbed you.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 12 Worthless people who act sinfully constantly deceive people by what they say.
\q1 \v 13 They gesture with their bodies to deceive people.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 14 They are always thinking perversely while planning how to do evil things.
\q2 They cause people to argue {with each other}.
\q1 \v 15 Because of this, disastrous things will suddenly happen to those people.
\q2 Someone will destroy them instantly and they will not be able to recover.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 16 Yahweh absolutely hates six, no, seven things:
\q3
\ts\*
\v 17 being proud, speaking falsely,
\q3 someone who murders a person who has not done anything wrong,
\q3 \v 18 someone who plans ways to act sinfully,
\q3 someone who is eager to act wickedly,
\q3 \v 19 someone who easily lies when testifying,
\q3 and someone who causes members of the same family to argue.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 20 My child, be mindful to obey what I, your father, have commanded {you}.
\q2 Indeed, obey the rules that your mother has commanded.
\q1 \v 21 Remember what we have taught you as if it were always a part of you.
\q2 Indeed, {remember these lessons as if} you wore them like a necklace.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 22 What we have taught you will cause you to know what you should do each day.
\q2 It will cause you to be safe when you sleep.
\q2 It will even be instructive for you when you wake up {in the morning}.
\q1 \v 23 {This is so} because what I have commanded {you} is {like} a lamp {for you}. 
\q2 Indeed, the rules {we taught you} are {like} a light {to guide you}.
\q2 When we rebuke you while instructing you, {we do that} so that you can do what will keep you alive.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 24 {We taught you these lessons} in order to prevent you from {going to} wicked women,
\q2 {and to prevent you} from {believing} what  immoral women say seductively.
\q1 \v 25 Do not think lustfully about her beautiful body.
\q2 Do not let her seduce you by the {flirtatious} way she looks at you.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 26 {Do not do so} because, although having sex with a prostitute only costs you the price of a cheap meal,
\q2 an {adulterous} married woman will cause you to die.
\q1 \v 27 Fire will surely burn people who put it on their chests!
\ts\*
\q1 \v 28 Burning coals will surely burn the feet of people who step on them!
\q1 \v 29 It is similar with anyone who acts adulterously with a married woman.
\q2 People will certainly punish anyone who does that.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 30 Nobody hates people who steal if they steal {food} in order to feed themselves when they are hungry.
\q1 \v 31 Nevertheless, if people catch thieves, those thieves must pay back seven times {as much as they stole to those whom they stole from}.
\q2 They must give everything that they have {in order to repay what they stole}.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 32 By contrast, a man who acts adulterously with a woman does not think wisely.
\q2 What he does will kill him!
\q1 \v 33 Someone will injure and disgrace him,
\q2 and he will always be ashamed.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 34 {This is so} because the jealous husband will become furious.
\q2 He will act mercilessly when he revenges himself {on the man who acted adulterously with his wife}.
\q1 \v 35 That jealous husband will not accept any money {to stop being furious}, 
\q2 no matter how much money you offer him.


\ts\*

\c 7
\q1 
\v 1 My son, obey what I have told you.
\q2 Sincerely consider what I have commanded {you} to be precious.
\q1 \v 2 Do what I have commanded {you}, so that you will keep on living.
\q2 Consider the rules I have taught you to be the most precious things you possess.
\q1 \v 3 {Always remember what I have commanded you as if} it were tied around your fingers.
\q2 Remember it at all times!
\ts\*
\q1 \v 4 Love what is wise as if it were your sister.
\q2 Indeed, love what you should understand as if it were a close relative.
\q1 \v 5 {Do this} so that you will be able to stay away from adulterous women,
\q2 and {stay away} from immoral women who speak {to you} seductively.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 6 {I was} once {standing} near the window {in my house},
\q2 and I looked down {from above the street} through the shutters on the window.
\q1 \v 7 Then I observed {someone} among the naive people.
\q2 I noticed among the youths a young man who does not think wisely.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 8 He walked down the street near the corner of {the road where} the adulterous woman {dwells}.
\q2 Then he walked toward the place where she dwelled.
\q1 \v 9 (It was the time of day when night begins, {and then} it became dark.)

\ts\*
\q1 \v 10 Suddenly an adulterous woman approached the young man.
\q2 She was wearing a prostitute’s clothing and intended to deceive {the young man}.

\q1 \v 23 Yahweh detests {people dishonestly using} differing weights {to benefit themselves}.
\q2 Indeed, {using} weighing instruments in order to deceive {others} is very bad.
\q1 \v 24 Yahweh directs what happens to powerful people.
\q2 So then, people surely cannot comprehend what will happen to them!

\ts\*
\q1 \v 25 It is dangerous for people to declare thoughtlessly that something is holy to Yahweh,

\q1 \v 27 People’s spirits are {like} lamps that Yahweh has given them;

\q1 \v 28 Being faithful and trustworthy makes kings safe.
\q2 Indeed, being faithful enables them to rule securely.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 29 People admire young men because they are strong,

\q1 \v 2 People think that everything they do is right,
\q2 but Yahweh {rightly} evaluates what they think.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 3 Acting righteously and justly is more important to Yahweh
\q2 than sacrificing animals {to him}.
\q1 \v 4 Being proud and arrogant guide what wicked people do like a lamp {shows people where to go};
\q2 they are sinful.

\q1 \v 5 What diligent people plan will certainly profit them,

\q1 \v 11 If you punish people who ridicule others, {then} naive people {who see you do that} will become wise,

\q2 he destroys them.

\q1 \v 13 People who refuse to listen to poor people when they cry out {for help}
\q2 will also cry out {for help themselves}, but no one will help them.
\q1 \v 14 Secretly giving something to an angry person will stop them from being angry.
\q2 Indeed, secretly bribing a furious person will calm them down.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 15 Righteous people enjoy acting justly,
\q2 but acting justly terrifies people who act sinfully.
\q1 \v 16 People who stop behaving insightfully

\ts\*
\q1 \v 17 People who love what is pleasurable will be poor.
\q2 Indeed, people who love {luxuries like} wine and olive oil will never be rich.
\q1 \v 18 Wicked people will suffer instead of righteous people,
\q2 and treacherous people {will suffer} in place of upright people.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 19 It is better to live {alone} in a deserted land

\q1 \v 20 Wise people have precious riches and olive oil,

\ts\*
\q1 \v 21 People who diligently try to be righteous and faithful
\q2 will live {for a long time}, will be righteous, and people will respect them.
\q1 \v 22 Wise people conquer cities that mighty warriors are defending;

\q1 \v 23 People who are careful about anything they say

\q1 \v 27 What wicked people offer {to Yahweh} is detestable;

\q1 \v 30 There is absolutely nothing that is wise, understanding, and advisable, but is {also} the opposite of what Yahweh wants.

\q1 \v 2 Rich people and poor people have {at least} one thing in common:
\q2 Yahweh made both of them.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 3 Sensible people observe something dangerous happening and avoid it,

\q1 \v 4 People who are humble, who reverently fear Yahweh,

\q1 \v 7 Rich people reign over poor people,
\q2 and people who borrow {money} from others are slaves to the people who loaned them {money}.
\q1 \v 8 People who act unjustly will suffer for doing so,

\ts\*
\q1 \v 9 Yahweh will bless generous people
\q2 because they give their own food to poor people.
\q1 \v 10 If you banish people who ridicule others, then people will stop arguing {with each other},
\q2 quarreling {with each other}, and shaming {each other}.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 11 People who love thinking purely
\q2 speak graciously and are companions of kings.
\q1 \v 12 Yahweh preserves what people should know,

\q1 \v 13 Lazy people {do nothing because they} claim that there is a lion outside that will kill them in the street {if they go outside}.
\q1 \v 14 What adulterous women say is {as dangerous as} a deep hole;

\q1 \v 15 Children inherently think foolishly,

\ts\*
\q1 \v 22 Do not steal from poor people just because they are poor;

\q1 \v 23 {Do not do these things} because Yahweh will defend those poor people when you dispute with them,

\q1 \v 24 Do not become friends with angry people.

\q1 \v 26 Stay away from those people who agree to pay loans for others.
\q2 {Indeed, stay away from those people} who guarantee to pay the loans of others.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 28 Do not cheat people by moving the stones that their ancestors placed long ago

\ts\*
\q1 \v 6 Do not eat food that stingy people {give you}.
\q2 Do not crave the expensive food that they have,

\q2 They will tell you to eat and drink,

\q1 \v 10 Do not cheat people by moving the old stones that mark the boundaries of their land.

\q1 \v 26 My son, pay close attention to me!

\q2 They cause many men to become unfaithful.

\q1 \v 29 These are the kind of people who  are woeful, sorrowful, and quarrelsome,

\q1 \v 31 Do not {even} look with pleasure at wine, even though it is beautifully red, glistens in the cup,

\q1 \v 5 Wise people are strong,

\q1 \v 17 Do not be happy when something disastrous happens to your adversaries.

\v 1 Do not brag about what {you think} will happen tomorrow,
\q2 because you do not know what will happen then.
\q1 \v 2 Do not praise yourself; let someone else praise you.
\q2 Indeed, let someone who does not know you praise you, not yourself.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 3 Stones and sand are heavy,
\q2 but how provocative fools are is like something that is heavier than both of them.
\q1 \v 4 Angry people are cruel and furious people are destructive,
\q2 but no one can resist jealous people!
\ts\*
\q1 \v 5 It is better to correct people openly, than to love them without them knowing that you do.
\q1 \v 6 Friends will be faithful to you by criticizing you {when necessary},
\q2 but enemies will deceive you by acting affectionately toward you.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 7 When people who have full stomachs see {on the ground} honey dripping from the comb, they step on it {because they are not hungry}.
\q2 but even bitter things taste sweet to hungry people {because they are so hungry}.
\q1 \v 8 People who stray from their homes
\q2 are like birds that stray from their nests.

\q1 \v 9 Just as fragrant oil and perfume make people feel happy,
\q2 so when your friends advise you sincerely, they show how kind they are.
\q1 \v 10 Do not abandon your friends or your father’s friends.
\q2 Do not go to the houses of your relatives when something disastrous happens to you.
\q2 {Rather,} it is better to go to a neighbor than to relatives who live far away.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 11 My child, act wisely and make me happy,
\q2 so that I will be able to reply to anyone who argues against me.
\q1 \v 12 Sensible people observe something dangerous happening and avoid it,
\q2 but naive people {ignorantly} do not avoid it and suffer {for doing so}.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 13 Take the coats of people who promise to pay a loan for someone whom they do not know.
\q2 Indeed, hold onto the coats of people who do so for a foreigner.
\q1 \v 14 People will think that someone they know is cursing them if that person speaks loudly to bless them early in the morning.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 15 A wife who always argues {with you} is as {annoying as}

\q1 \v 16 It is as difficult to stop her {from arguing} as stopping the wind,

\ts\*
\q1 \v 17 Just as iron can sharpen an iron {blade}, so too people can help people they know improve how they think.
\q1 \v 18 Just as people who take care of fruit trees will eat the fruit from those trees {as a result},
\q2 so too will masters honor their servants who guard them.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 19 When people look in water, the water reflects their faces.
\q2 In the same way, what people think reveals what kinds of people they are.
\q1 \v 20 Just as the place where dead people go never becomes full;
\q2 so people never stop wanting {something}.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 21 People use crucibles and furnaces to test and refine silver and gold.
\q2 In the same way, people test what kind of person someone is by saying good things about that person.
\q1 \v 22 If you were to crush a fool the way you would crush grain {into powder},
\q2 you would still not be able to stop that person from acting foolishly.

\q1 \v 23 Be fully aware of how your sheep are doing.

\q2 Even a king’s family will not rule forever!
\q1 \v 25 Harvest the grass and then you will see new grass.
\q2 Collect {and store} the plants that grow on the hillside.

\q1 \v 26 {If you do these things, then} you will have lambs with wool that you can clothe yourself with. You will also have male goats that you can sell for enough money to buy a field.

\q1 \v 3 Poor people who oppress other poor people

\ts\*
\q1 \v 5 Evil people cannot comprehend what is just,
\q2 but people who desire to please Yahweh comprehend everything about it.
\q1 \v 6 It is better to be poor and act honestly
\q2 than to act dishonestly and be rich.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 7 People who obey {Yahweh’s} laws are discerning children,

\q1 \v 8 People who become wealthy by charging an unreasonably large amount of interest {from those to whom they loan money}
\q2 {unknowingly} collect that wealth to give it to people who are kind to poor people.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 9 Yahweh detests what people pray
\q2 if those people refuse to even listen to his laws.
\q1 \v 10 People who guide upright people to act evilly
\q2 will destroy themselves by what they do,
\q2 but people whom Yahweh does not blame {for acting wickedly} will receive what is good.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 11 Rich people may {wrongly} think that they are wise,
\q2 but discerning poor people will prove that those people are not {wise}.
\q1 \v 12 People celebrate when righteous people become powerful,
\q2 but people hide when wicked people become powerful.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 13 People who {try to} hide the sinful things that they do will never be successful,
\q2 but Yahweh will be merciful to people who confess the sinful things that they have done and stop doing them.
\q1 \v 14 People who always reverently fear Yahweh are happy,
\q2 but bad things happen to stubborn people.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 15 Wicked people who rule over poor people are {as dangerous as}

\q1 \v 16 Leaders who are not understanding severely oppress {other people},

\q1 \v 17 People who murder others will keep running away {from those who would punish them} until they die.
\q2 Do not help them!
\q1 \v 18 Yahweh will rescue people whom he does not blame for how they act,
\q2 but people who act dishonestly will suddenly ruin themselves.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 19 People who work hard will have enough food {to eat},
\q2 but people who waste time doing worthless things will only be poor.
\q1 \v 20 Yahweh abundantly blesses faithful people,
\q2 but he will certainly punish people who are eager to be wealthy.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 21 Although it is very evil to favor someone,
\q2 some people will sin {by doing so} to get as little as a scrap of food.
\q1 \v 22 Although people who are eager to become rich are stingy,
\q2 they do not realize that they will become poor.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 23 People approve of someone who corrects them after that person does so
\q2 more than {they might approve of} someone who speaks flatteringly {to them}.
\q1 \v 24 People who rob their parents and say that doing so is not wrong
\q2 are as bad as murderers.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 25 Greedy people cause people to argue with each other,

\q1 \v 26 People who trust themselves are foolish,
\q2 but people who act wisely are the ones who will escape {what is dangerous}.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 27 People who give poor people {what they need} will have all that they need,

\q1 \v 28 People hide when wicked people become powerful,

\q1 \v 2 People are joyful when righteous people become numerous,

\ts\*
\q1 \v 3 People who cherish what is wise make their fathers happy,

\q1 \v 7 Righteous people care about the rights of poor people,

\q1 \v 8 People who mock others agitate people living in a city,

\q1 \v 9 If wise people sue foolish people,

\q1 \v 11 Foolish people uncontrollably express everything that they feel,
\q2 but wise people control how they express what they feel.
\q1 \v 12 Leaders who believe the false things that people tell them

\ts\*
\q1 \v 13 Poor people and the people who oppress {them} have {at least} one thing in common:
\q2 Yahweh is the one who caused them to live.
\q1 \v 14 Kings who judge poor people according to what is true
\q2 will always rule securely.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 15 If parents punish and correct their children, doing so can make those children wise;

\q1 \v 17 Discipline your children, so that they will make you feel peaceful

\ts\*
\q1 \v 19 You cannot correct servants by {only} speaking to them
\q2 because they will not respond to you, even if they understand {what you say}.
\q1 \v 20 Consider this: Foolish people are more likely to improve themselves
\q2 than people who speak thoughtlessly.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 21 If you give your servants everything they want when they are young,

\q1 \v 22 People who easily become angry cause people to argue.
\q2 Indeed, angry people cause people to sin.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 23 People will humiliate proud people for being proud,

\q1 \v 24 People who help thieves only hurt themselves.
\q2 They hear that Yahweh will curse them {for not speaking what is true}, but they do not say anything.

\q1 \v 25 Being anxious is {as dangerous as} a trap,

\q2 {I also ask that he} not let me become too poor or too rich,
\q2 {but} just provide the proper amount of food for me.
\q1 \v 9 If I become too rich, then I may reject Yahweh and claim that I do not know him.
\q2 Or if I become too poor, then I may rob {other people},
\q2 so that I dishonor my God.

\q1 \v 21 There are three, no, four things that {the people in} the world cannot tolerate:
\q1 \v 22 when slaves become rulers,

\q1 \v 23 when women whom people hate marry someone,
\q1 and when servant girls replace the wives of their masters.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 24 There are four creatures in the world that are small

\q2 during the right time they store their food {to eat during the winter}.
\q1 \v 26 Although hyraxes are weak animals,
\q2 they make their homes {among the rocks} on cliffs.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 27 Although locusts do not have a king,

\q1 \v 28 Although lizards are small enough to hold in your hands,

\ts\*
\q1 \v 29 There are three, no, four things that look very impressive when they walk:

\q1 \v 4 Lemuel, kings should certainly not drink wine,

\q1 \v 6 Let dying people drink what can intoxicate {them},
