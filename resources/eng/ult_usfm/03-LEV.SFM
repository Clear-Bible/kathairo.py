\c 1
\p \v 1 And Yahweh called to Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting, saying,\v 2 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When a man among you offers an offering to Yahweh, from the livestock, either from the herd or from the flock you must offer your offering.
\p \v 3 If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he must offer a male without blemish. At the entrance of the tent of meeting he must offer it, so that it may be accepted before the face of Yahweh.\v 4 And he is to lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering. And it will be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for him.\v 5 And he must slaughter the son of the herd before the face of Yahweh. And the sons of Aaron, the priests, will offer the blood and sprinkle the blood on every side of the altar that is at the entrance of the tent of meeting.\v 6 And he must skin the burnt offering and cut it into its pieces.\v 7 And the sons of Aaron the priest will put fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire.\v 8 And the sons of Aaron, the priests, must place the pieces, the head and the fat, on the wood that is on the fire that is on the altar.\v 9 And he must wash with water its inner parts and its legs. And the priest will burn everything on the altar as a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to Yahweh.
\p \v 10 And if his offering is from the flock, from the sheep or from the goats, as a burnt offering, he must offer a male without blemish.\v 11 And he must slaughter it on the side of the altar northward before the face of Yahweh. And the sons of Aaron, the priests, will sprinkle its blood on every side of the altar.\v 12 And he is to cut it into its pieces with its head and its fat. And the priest must place them on the wood that is on the fire that is on the altar.\v 13 And he must wash with water the inner parts and the legs. And the priest will offer everything, and burn it on the altar. It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to Yahweh.
\p \v 14 And if his offering to Yahweh is to be a burnt offering of birds, then he must offer his offering from the turtledoves or from the sons of the pigeon.\v 15 And the priest must bring it to the altar and wring off its head, and burn it on the altar. And its blood must be drained out on the side of the altar.\v 16 And he must remove its crop with its plumage, and throw it beside the altar on the east side, in the place for the ashes.\v 17 And he must tear it open by its wings; he must not divide it into two parts. And the priest will burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire. It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to Yahweh.
\c 2
\p \v 1 And when a person brings a grain offering to Yahweh, his offering must be fine flour. And he will pour oil on it and put incense on it.\v 2 And he will bring it to the sons of Aaron, the priests, and take out from it his handful of its fine flour and of its oil with all its incense. And the priest will burn its memorial portion on the altar as an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to Yahweh.\v 3 And what is left of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and to his sons. It is the holiest holy thing from the offerings made by fire to Yahweh.
\p \v 4 And when you offer a grain offering that is baked in an oven, it must be cakes of fine flour without yeast mixed with oil or wafers without yeast spread with oil.\v 5 And if your offering is a grain offering made on the griddle, it must be of fine flour without yeast that is mixed with oil.\v 6 You are to divide it into pieces and pour oil on it. This is a grain offering.\v 7 And if your offering is a grain offering cooked in a pan, it must be made of fine flour with oil.\v 8 And you must bring the grain offering that is made from these things to Yahweh. And it will be presented to the priest, and he will bring it to the altar.\v 9 And the priest will take from the grain offering its memorial portion, and he will burn it on the altar. It is an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to Yahweh.\v 10 And what is left of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and to his sons. It is the holiest holy thing from the offerings made by fire to Yahweh.
\p \v 11 Every grain offering that you offer to Yahweh must not be made with yeast. For you must not burn any leaven or any honey with it as an offering made by fire to Yahweh.\v 12 You will offer them to Yahweh as an offering of firstfruits, but on the altar they will not ascend as a sweet aroma.\v 13 And every offering of your grain offerings you must season with salt. And you must never allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be missing from your grain offering. With all your offerings you must offer salt.
\p \v 14 And if you offer a grain offering of firstfruits to Yahweh, you must offer a grain offering of your firstfruits that is fresh grain roasted with fire, crushed new grain.\v 15 And you must put oil on it and you must put incense on it. This is a grain offering.\v 16 And the priest will burn as its memorial portion some of its crushed grain and some of its oil with all its incense. This is an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
\c 3
\p \v 1 And if a sacrifice of peace offering is his offering, if he is offering from the herd, whether male or female, he must offer it without blemish before the face of Yahweh.\v 2 And he will lay his hand on the head of his offering and he will slaughter it at the door of the tent of meeting. And the sons of Aaron, the priests, will sprinkle the blood on every side of the altar.\v 3 And he will offer from the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire to Yahweh: the fat covering the inner parts and all the fat that is on the inner parts,\v 4 and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them which is by the loins, and the lobe on the liver which he will remove with the kidneys.\v 5 And the sons of Aaron will burn it on the altar with the burnt offering that is on the wood that is on the fire. It is an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to Yahweh.
\p \v 6 And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering to Yahweh is from the flock; male or female, he must offer it without blemish.\v 7 If he offers a lamb for his offering, then he must offer it before the face of Yahweh.\v 8 And he will lay his hand on the head of his sacrifice and slaughter it before the tent of meeting. And the sons of Aaron will sprinkle its blood on every side of the altar.\v 9 And he will offer from the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire to Yahweh: its fat, the entire fat tail which he will remove near the backbone, and the fat covering the inner parts and all the fat that is on the inner parts,\v 10 and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the lobe on the liver which he will remove with the kidneys.\v 11 And the priest will burn it on the altar as food, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
\p \v 12 And if a goat is his offering, then he will offer it before the face of Yahweh.\v 13 And he must lay his hand on its head and slaughter it before the face of the tent of meeting. And the sons of Aaron will sprinkle its blood on every side of the altar.\v 14 And he will offer from it his offering as an offering made by fire to Yahweh: the fat covering the inner parts and all the fat that is on the inner parts,\v 15 and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the lobe on the liver which he will remove with the kidneys.\v 16 And the priest will burn them on the altar as food, an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma. All the fat belongs to Yahweh.\v 17 It will be a permanent statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings: you must not eat any fat or any blood.’”
\c 4
\p \v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 2 “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘When a person sins by mistake in any of the commands of Yahweh, about what must not be done, and does any of one them,\v 3 if the annointed priest sins so as to bring guilt on the people, then he will offer for his sin which he has sinned a bull, a son of the herd, without blemish to Yahweh as a sin offering.\v 4 And he must bring the bull to the entrance of the tent of meeting before the face of Yahweh. And he must lay his hand on the head of the bull and slaughter the bull before the face of Yahweh.\v 5 And the anointed priest will take some of the blood of the bull and bring it to the tent of meeting.\v 6 And the priest will dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of the blood seven times before the face of Yahweh, at the face of the curtain of the holy place.\v 7 And the priest will put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense before the face of Yahweh, which is in the tent of meeting. And he will pour out all the blood of the bull at the base of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the entrance of the tent of meeting.\v 8 And all the fat of the bull of the sin offering he will remove from it: the fat covering over the inner parts and all the fat that is on the inner parts,\v 9 and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the lobe on the liver which he will remove with the kidneys—\v 10 just as it is removed from the ox of the sacrifice of the peace offering. And the priest will burn them on the altar of the burnt offering.\v 11 And the skin of the bull and all its flesh, with its head and with its legs and its inner parts and its dung—\v 12 all of the bull— he will bring out to the outside of the camp to a clean place, to the heap of the ash, and he will burn it on wood with fire. It will be burned on the heap of the ash.
\p \v 13 And if the whole congregation of Israel strays unintentionally and the matter is concealed from the eyes of the assembly and they do one thing from all the commands of Yahweh which are not to be done and they become guilty,\v 14 and the sin which they have sinned against it becomes known, then the assembly must offer a bull, a son of the herd, for a sin offering. And they must bring it before the face of the tent of meeting.\v 15 And the elders of the congregation will lay their hands on the head of the bull before the face of Yahweh. And the bull will be slaughtered before the face of Yahweh.\v 16 And the anointed priest will bring some of the blood of the bull to the tent of meeting.\v 17 And the priest will dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the face of Yahweh, at the face of the curtain.\v 18 And he will put some of the blood on the horns of the altar that is before the face of Yahweh, which is in the tent of meeting. And he will pour out all the blood at the base of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the entrance of the tent of meeting.\v 19 And all its fat he will remove from it and burn on the altar.\v 20 And he must do with the bull just as he did with the bull of the sin offering, thus he will do with it. And the priest will make atonement for them, and it will be forgiven them.\v 21 And he will bring out the bull to the outside of the camp and he will burn it just as he burned the first bull. This is the sin offering of the assembly.
\p \v 22 When a ruler sins and does by mistake one thing from all the commands of Yahweh his God that should not be done, and he becomes guilty,\v 23 or his sin by which he has sinned is made known to him, then he must bring as his offering a buck of the goats, a male without blemish.\v 24 And he will lay his hand on the head of the goat and slaughter it in the place where he slaughters the burnt offering before the face of Yahweh. This is a sin offering.\v 25 And the priest will take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of the burnt offering. And he will pour out its blood at the base of the altar of the burnt offering.\v 26 And he will burn all the fat on the altar, just like the fat of the sacrifice of the peace offerings. And the priest will make atonement for him concerning his sin, and it will be forgiven him.
\p \v 27 And if any person from the people of the land sins by mistake, doing one thing from the commands of Yahweh that must not be done, and he becomes guilty,\v 28 or his sin which he sinned is made known to him, then he will bring for his offering a doe of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin that he has sinned.\v 29 And he will lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter the sin offering at the place of the burnt offering.\v 30 And the priest will take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of the burnt offering. And he will pour out all its blood at the base of the altar.\v 31 And he will remove all the fat, just as the fat is removed from on the sacrifice of the peace offerings. And the priest will burn it on the altar as a sweet aroma to Yahweh. And the priest will make atonement for him, and it will be forgiven him.
\p \v 32 And if he brings a lamb as his offering for a sin offering, he will bring a female without blemish.\v 33 And he will lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it for a sin offering at the place where he slaughters the burnt offering.\v 34 And the priest will take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of the burnt offering. And he will pour out all its blood at the base of the altar.\v 35 And he will remove all the fat, just as the fat of the lamb is removed from the sacrifice of the peace offerings. And the priest will burn them on the altar on top of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire. And the priest will make atonement for him for his sin that he has sinned, and it will be forgiven him.
\c 5
\p \v 1 And when a person sins in that he hears the utterance of a curse and he is a witness, whether he has seen or known of it, if he does not tell, then he will bear his iniquity.\v 2 Or if a person touches any unclean thing, whether it be the carcass of an unclean wild animal or the carcass of unclean livestock or the carcass of an unclean creeping animal, and it is concealed from him, then he is unclean and guilty.\v 3 Or if he touches the uncleanness of a human, of all his uncleanness that one becomes unclean by, and it is concealed from him but he comes to know of it, then he will be guilty.\v 4 Or if a person swears rashly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, anything that a man swears rashly, and it is concealed from him but he comes to know of it, then he will be guilty, in any of these things.\v 5 And it will be that when someone is guilty in one of these things, he must confess that in which he has sinned.\v 6 And he must bring his guilt offering to Yahweh for his sin that he has sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb, or a doe of the goats, for a sin offering. And the priest will make atonement for him concerning his sin.
\p \v 7 And if his hand does not touch enough small livestock, then he can bring as his guilt offering because he sinned two turtledoves or two sons of the pigeon to Yahweh, one for a sin offering and one for a burnt offering.\v 8 And he must bring them to the priest, and he will offer that which is for the sin offering first. And he will wring off its head from the front of its neck, but he will not sever it.\v 9 And he will sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar. And the rest of the blood he will drain out at the base of the altar. This is the sin offering.\v 10 And he must make a burnt offering of the second one, according to the regulation. And the priest will make atonement for him for his sin that he sinned, and it will be forgiven for him.
\p \v 11 And if his hand cannot touch two turtledoves or two sons of the pigeon, then he must bring as his sacrifice because he sinned a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering. He must not put oil on it nor put incense on it, for it is a sin offering.\v 12 And he must bring it to the priest, and the priest will take from it his handful as its memorial portion. And he will burn it on the altar, on top of the offerings made by fire to Yahweh. This is the sin offering.\v 13 And the priest will make atonement for him, for his sin that he sinned from one of these, and it will be forgiven for him. And it will belong to the priest, as with the grain offering.’”
\p \v 14 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 15 “If a person acts unfaithfully and sins by mistake with the holy things of Yahweh, then he must bring his guilt offering to Yahweh, a ram without blemish from the flock with your valuation of silver shekels, in the shekel of the holy place, as a guilt offering.\v 16 And for what he sinned in connection with the holy thing he must make restitution, and one- fifth of it he must add to it and give it to the priest. And the priest will make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and it will be forgiven for him.
\p \v 17 And if a person sins and does one thing from all the commands of Yahweh that must not be done, and he does not know, then he is guilty and must bear his iniquity.\v 18 And he must bring to the priest a ram without blemish from the flock, with your valuation, as a guilt offering. And the priest will make atonement for him concerning his mistake which he made unintentionally and did not know it, and it will be forgiven for him.\v 19 It is a guilt offering. He is certainly guilty to Yahweh.”
\c 6
\p \v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 2 “If a person sins and acts unfaithfully against Yahweh and deceives his fellow citizen, in a deposit or in a pledge of hand or by theft, or if he has oppressed his fellow citizen,\v 3 or he has found something lost and lies about it, or he swears falsely, according to one of all the things which mankind does to sin thereby,\v 4 and it happened that he has sinned and is guilty, then he must give back the robbed thing that he stole or the extorted thing that he extorted, or the deposit which was entrusted to him, or the lost thing that he had found;\v 5 or from all that he has sworn about falsely, he must restore it in full and he must add one- fifth its value to it. He must give it to whom it belongs on the day of his guilt offering.\v 6 And he must bring his guilt offering to Yahweh, a ram without blemish from the flock with your estimate of its value, as a guilt offering to the priest.\v 7 And the priest will make atonement for him before the face of Yahweh, and it will be forgiven for him, concerning one thing from all that one does by which to become guilty.”
\p \v 8 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 9 “Command Aaron and his sons, saying, ‘This is the law of the burnt offering: The burnt offering itself must be on the hearth on the altar all the night until the morning. And the fire of the altar will be kept burning on it.\v 10 And the priest will put on his linen robe and he will put on his linen underclothes over his body. And he will pick up the ashes, which is the burnt offering the fire has consumed on the altar. And he will put it beside the altar.\v 11 And he will take off his garments and put on other garments. And he will bring out the ash to the outside of the camp, to a clean place.\v 12 And the fire on the altar will be kept burning on it. It must not go out, and the priest will kindle wood on it in the morning by the morning. And he will arrange the burnt offering on it, and he will burn on it the fat of the peace offerings.\v 13 Fire must be kept burning on the altar continually. It must not go out.
\p \v 14 And this is the law of the grain offering. The sons of Aaron will offer it before the face of Yahweh at the face of the altar.\v 15 And he will take up from it his handful of the fine flour of the grain offering and of the oil and all the incense which is on the grain offering. And he will burn it on the altar as a sweet aroma, its memorial portion to Yahweh.\v 16 And Aaron and his sons will eat what is left from it. It must be eaten without yeast in a holy place. They will eat it in the courtyard of the tent of meeting.\v 17 It must not be baked with yeast. I have given it as their part from my offerings made by fire. It is the holiest holy thing, like the sin offering and like the guilt offering.\v 18 Every male from the sons of Aaron may eat it as a permanent statute throughout your generations, from the offerings of Yahweh made by fire. All that touches them will become holy.’”
\p \v 19 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 20 “This is the offering of Aaron and his sons, which they will offer to Yahweh on the day when he is anointed: a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour as a continual grain offering, half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening.\v 21 It will be made with oil on a griddle. When it is well- mixed, you will bring it. In baked pieces you will offer the grain offering as a sweet aroma to Yahweh.\v 22 And the annointed priest that comes after him from among his sons will offer it. As a permanent statute it shall be completely burned up to Yahweh.\v 23 And all of the grain offering of the priest will be completely burned up. It must not be eaten.”
\p \v 24 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 25 “Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, ‘This is the law of the sin offering: in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered the sin offering must be slaughtered before the face of Yahweh. It is the holiest holy thing.\v 26 The priest who offers it as a sin offering will eat it. It must be eaten in a holy place, in the courtyard of the tent of meeting.\v 27 All that touches its meat will become holy. And if some of the blood is sprinkled on the garment, you must clean where it was sprinkled on it in a holy place.\v 28 And the pot of clay in which it is boiled must be broken. And if it is boiled in a pot of bronze, then it must be scrubbed and rinsed in water.\v 29 Every male among the priests may eat it. It is the holiest holy thing.\v 30 And any sin offering from which some of its blood was brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place must not be eaten. It must be burned in the fire.
\c 7
\p \v 1 And this is the law of the guilt offering. It is the holiest holy thing.\v 2 In the place where they slaughter the burnt offering they must slaughter the guilt offering. And they must sprinkle its blood on every side of the altar.\v 3 And all its fat will be offered from it: the fat tail and the fat covering the inner parts,\v 4 and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the lobe on the liver which he will remove with the kidneys.\v 5 And the priest must burn them on the altar as an offering made by fire to Yahweh. It is a guilt offering.\v 6 Every male among the priests may eat it. It must be eaten in a holy place. It is the holiest holy thing.\v 7 The sin offering is like the guilt offering. The law is the same for them. The priest who makes atonement with it; it will belong to him.\v 8 As for the priest who offers a burnt offering of a man, the hide of the burnt offering that he offered will belong to the priest. It will belong to him.\v 9 And every grain offering that is baked in an oven, and everything cooked in a frying pan or on a griddle will belong to the priest who offers it. It will belong to him.\v 10 And every grain offering, mixed with oil or dry, will be for all the sons of Aaron, to each as to his brother.
\p \v 11 And this is the law of the sacrifice of the peace offerings which they will offer to Yahweh.\v 12 If one offers it for thanksgiving, then he must offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving cakes without yeast mixed with oil and wafers without yeast smeared with oil and well- mixed cakes of fine flour mixed with oil.\v 13 With the cakes he must offer bread with yeast as his offering, in addition to the thanksgiving sacrifice of his peace offerings.\v 14 And he will offer from it one from each offering as a gift to Yahweh. It will belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings. It will belong to him.
\p \v 15 And the meat of the thanksgiving sacrifice of the peace offerings must be eaten on the day of his offering. He must not leave any of it until morning.\v 16 And if the sacrifice of his offering is for a vow or for a freewill offering, it may be eaten on the day he offers his sacrifice. And the next day whatever remains of it may be eaten.\v 17 And what is left from the meat of the sacrifice must be burned in the fire on the third day.\v 18 And if any of the meat of the sacrifice of his peace offerings to be eaten is eaten on the third day, it will not be accepted. It will not be credited to the one who offered it. It will be a disgusting thing, and the person who eats some of it will carry his iniquity.
\p \v 19 And the meat that touches any unclean thing must not be eaten. It must be burned in the fire. But the meat, anyone who is clean may eat meat.\v 20 And a person who eats meat from the sacrifice of the peace offerings that belong to Yahweh while his uncleanness is on him, that person must be cut off from his people.\v 21 And a person who touches any unclean thing, the uncleanness of a human, or an unclean animal, or any unclean detestable thing, and eats some of the meat of a sacrifice of the peace offerings that belong to Yahweh, that person must be cut off from his people.’”
\p \v 22 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 23 “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘You must not eat any of the fat of an ox or a sheep or a goat.\v 24 And the fat of a carcass or the fat of an animal torn by wild animals may be used for any other use, but you must certainly not eat it.\v 25 If anyone eats fat from the animal which he has offered part of it as a sacrifice made by fire to Yahweh, then the person who ate it must be cut off from his people.\v 26 And you must not eat any blood in any of your dwellings, whether of a bird or of a land animal.\v 27 Any person who eats any blood, that person must be cut off from his people.’”
\p \v 28 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 29 “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘He who offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to Yahweh must bring his offering to Yahweh from the sacrifice of his peace offerings.\v 30 His hands must bring an offering made by fire to Yahweh: the fat with the breast. He must bring the breast to wave it as a wave offering before the face of Yahweh.\v 31 And the priest must burn the fat on the altar, and the breast will be for Aaron and for his sons.\v 32 And the right thigh you must give as a gift to the priest from the sacrifices of your peace offerings.\v 33 The one from the sons of Aaron who offers the blood of the peace offerings and the fat will have for him the right thigh as a share.\v 34 For I have taken from the sons of Israel, from the sacrifices of their peace offerings, the breast of the wave offering, and the thigh that is the gift. And I have given them to Aaron the priest and his sons as a permanent statute among the sons of Israel.
\p \v 35 This is the share of Aaron and the share of his sons from the offerings made by fire to Yahweh, on the day when he offered them as priests to Yahweh,\v 36 which Yahweh commanded to give them on the day of his anointing them from the people of Israel. It will be a permanent statute throughout their generations.
\p \v 37 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the grain offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering, and of the consecration offering, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings,\v 38 which Yahweh commanded Moses on Mount Sinai on the day he commanded the sons of Israel to offer their offerings to Yahweh in the wilderness of Sinai.’”
\c 8
\p \v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 2 “Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the oil of anointing, and the bull of the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread.\v 3 And bring together all the assembly at the entrance of the tent of meeting.”\v 4 And Moses did as Yahweh commanded him, and the assembly came together at the entrance of the tent of meeting.\v 5 And Moses said to the assembly, “This is the thing that Yahweh has commanded to be done.”
\p \v 6 Moses brought near Aaron and his sons and washed them with water.\v 7 And he put the tunic on him, and girded him with the sash, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod on him. And he girded him with the finely- woven waistband of the ephod and bound it on him.\v 8 And he placed the breastpiece on him, and in the breastpiece he put the Urim and the Thummim.\v 9 And he set the turban on his head and he set on the turban— on the front of its face— the golden rosette, the holy crown, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\p \v 10 And Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it. And he set them apart.\v 11 And he sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the washbasin and its base, to set them apart.\v 12 And he poured some of the anointing oil on the head of Aaron and anointed him to set him apart.\v 13 And Moses brought near the sons of Aaron and clothed them with tunics, and girded them with sashes, and bound headbands on them, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\p \v 14 And Moses brought the bull of the sin offering. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering.\v 15 And Moses slaughtered it, and he took the blood and put it all around on the horns of the altar with his finger. And he purified the altar and poured out the blood at the base of the altar. And he set it apart to make atonement upon it.\v 16 And he took all the fat that was on the inner parts, the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat, and Moses burned it on the altar.\v 17 And the bull and its hide and its flesh and its dung he burned in the fire outside the camp, as Yahweh had commanded him.
\p \v 18 And he brought near the ram of the burnt offering. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.\v 19 And Moses slaughtered it and sprinkled the blood against every side of the altar.\v 20 And Moses cut the ram into its pieces and burned the head and the pieces and the suet.\v 21 And the inner parts and the legs he washed with water. And Moses burned all of the ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering, a sweet aroma. It was an offering made by fire to Yahweh as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\p \v 22 And he brought near the second ram, the ram of consecration. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.\v 23 And Moses slaughtered it and took some of its blood and put it on the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.\v 24 And he brought near the sons of Aaron. And Moses put some of the blood on the tip of their right ear, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the big toe of their right foot. And Moses sprinkled the blood against every side of the altar.\v 25 And he took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was on the inner parts, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh.\v 26 And from the basket of bread without yeast that was before the face of Yahweh he took one cake without yeast, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat and on the right thigh.\v 27 And he put it all in the hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons and waved them before the face of Yahweh as a wave offering.\v 28 And Moses took them from off their hands and burned them on the altar for the burnt offering. They were a consecration offering, a sweet aroma. It was an offering made by fire to Yahweh.\v 29 And Moses took the breast and waved it as a wave offering to the face of Yahweh. It was the share for Moses from the ram of consecration, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\p \v 30 And Moses took some of the oil of anointing and some of the blood that was on the altar and he sprinkled these on Aaron, on his clothes, and on his sons, and on the clothes of his sons with him. And he set apart Aaron, his clothes, and his sons and the clothes of his sons with him.
\p \v 31 And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, “Boil the meat at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and there you will eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons will eat it.’\v 32 And what is left of the meat and of the bread you must burn in the fire.\v 33 And you must not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the day of the fulfillment of the days of your consecration, because for seven days he will fill your hands.\v 34 As has been done this day, Yahweh has commanded to be done to make atonement for you.\v 35 And at the entrance of the tent of meeting you will stay day and night for seven days. And you will keep the command of Yahweh, and you will not die, because this is what I have been commanded.”\v 36 And Aaron and his sons did all the things which Yahweh had commanded by the hand of Moses.
\c 9
\p \v 1 Now it was that on the eighth day Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel.\v 2 And he said to Aaron, “Take for yourself a calf, a son of the herd, for a sin offering, and a ram without blemish for a burnt offering, and offer them before the face of Yahweh.\v 3 And to the sons of Israel you must speak, saying, ‘Take a buck of the goats for a sin offering and a calf and a lamb, sons of the year without blemish, for a burnt offering,\v 4 and an ox and a ram for peace offerings to sacrifice before the face of Yahweh, and a grain offering mixed with oil, because today Yahweh will appear to you.’”\v 5 And they brought what Moses commanded to the entrance of the tent of meeting. And all the assembly came near and stood before the face of Yahweh.\v 6 And Moses said, “This is the thing that Yahweh commanded you to do, so the glory of Yahweh may appear to you.”\v 7 And Moses said to Aaron, “Come near to the altar and offer your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself and for the people. And offer the sacrifice of the people and make atonement for them, as Yahweh has commanded.”
\p \v 8 And Aaron went near to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.\v 9 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar. And he poured out the blood at the base of the altar.\v 10 And the fat and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver from the sin offering he burned on the altar, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.\v 11 And the flesh and the hide he burned in the fire outside the camp.
\p \v 12 And he slaughtered the burnt offering. And the sons of Aaron brought to him the blood, and he sprinkled it against every side of the altar.\v 13 And they brought to him the burnt offering in its pieces, with the head, and he burned them on the altar.\v 14 And he washed the inner parts and the legs and burned them on top of the burnt offering on the altar.
\p \v 15 And he offered the offering of the people. And he took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people and he slaughtered it and offered it for sin, like the first one.\v 16 And he offered the burnt offering and did it according to the ordinance.\v 17 And he presented the grain offering. And he filled his hand with it and burned it on the altar, along with the burnt offering of the morning.
\p \v 18 And he slaughtered the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of the peace offerings, which was for the people. And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him and he sprinkled it against every side of the altar.\v 19 As for the fat portions from the bull and from the ram, the fat tail, and the fat covering the inner parts, and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver,\v 20 they then put the fat portions on the breasts, and he burned the fat portions on the altar.\v 21 And the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved as a wave offering before the face of Yahweh, as Moses had commanded.
\p \v 22 And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them. And he came down from offering the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings.\v 23 And Moses and Aaron came into the tent of meeting, and they went out and blessed the people. And the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the people.\v 24 And fire came out from before the face of Yahweh and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar. And all the people saw and shouted and fell upon their faces.
\c 10
\p \v 1 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, a man took his censer, and they put fire in it and they put incense on it. And they offered before the face of Yahweh unfamiliar fire that he had not commanded them.\v 2 And fire went out from before the face of Yahweh and it devoured them. And they died before the face of Yahweh.\v 3 And Moses said to Aaron, “This is what Yahweh spoke, saying,
\q ‘Among those who come near me I will show myself as set apart. And on the faces of all the people I will be glorified.’”
\m And Aaron was silent.\v 4 And Moses called to Mishael and to Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron. And he said to them, “Come near and carry your brothers from the face of the holy place to the outside of the camp.”\v 5 And they came near and carried them by their tunics to the outside of the camp, as Moses had instructed.\v 6 And Moses said to Aaron and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, “Do not let your heads be unbound, and do not tear your clothes, and you will not die, and he does not become angry against all the assembly. But your brothers, all of the house of Israel, may weep for the burning that Yahweh burned.\v 7 And you must not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting, or else you will die, for the oil of anointing of Yahweh is on you.” And they acted according to the instructions of Moses.
\p \v 8 And Yahweh spoke to Aaron, saying,\v 9 “Do not drink wine or intoxicating drink, you, or your sons with you, when you go into the tent of meeting, and you will not die. It is a permanent statute throughout your generations,\v 10 so to distinguish between the set apart and the common, and between the unclean and the clean,\v 11 so that you may teach the sons of Israel all the statutes that Yahweh has spoken to them by the hand of Moses.”
\p \v 12 And Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his remaining sons, “Take the grain offering, the remains from the offerings made by fire to Yahweh, and eat it without yeast beside the altar, for it is the holiest holy thing.\v 13 And you must eat it in a holy place, because it is your share and the share of your sons from the offerings made by fire to Yahweh, for thus I have been commanded.\v 14 And the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the gift, you must eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you, for they are given as your share and the share of your sons from the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the sons of Israel.\v 15 The thigh of the gift and the breast of the wave offering, in addition to the fat portions of the offerings made by fire, they must bring to wave as a wave offering before the face of Yahweh. And it will belong to you and to your sons with you as a share forever, as Yahweh has commanded.”
\p \v 16 And the goat of the sin offering Moses searched carefully for, but behold, it had burned up! And he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the remaining sons of Aaron; saying,\v 17 “Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, since it is the holiest holy thing, and it he has given to you to take away the iniquity of the assembly, to make atonement for them before the face of Yahweh?\v 18 Look, its blood was not brought to the inner holy place. You should certainly have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded!”\v 19 And Aaron spoke to Moses, “Look, today they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the face of Yahweh, and such things as these have happened to me. If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been pleasing in the eyes of Yahweh?”\v 20 And Moses heard and it was good in his eyes.
\c 11
\p \v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them,\v 2 “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘These are the living things which you may eat among all the animals that are on the earth.\v 3 Any one that divides the hoof, and splits the cleft hoof, one that chews the cud among the animals— it you may eat.\v 4 However, these you must not eat among those that chew the cud or among those that divide the hoof: the camel because it is one that chews the cud but is not one that divides the hoof— it is unclean to you.\v 5 And the rock badger, because it is one that chews the cud but the hoof is not divided— it is unclean to you.\v 6 And the rabbit, because it is one that chews the cud, but the hoof is not divided— it is unclean to you.\v 7 And the pig, because it is one that divides the hoof and one that splits the cleft hoof, but it does not chew the cud— it is unclean to you.\v 8 You must not eat of their meat, and you must not touch their carcasses. They are unclean to you.
\p \v 9 This you may eat from all that are in the water: all that have fins and scales in the water, in the seas and in the rivers, them you may eat.\v 10 But all that do not have fins and scales in the seas and in the rivers, among every swarm of the water and among all the living creatures that are in the water, they are detestable to you.\v 11 And they must be detestable to you. You must not eat of their meat, and you must detest their carcasses.\v 12 All that does not have fins and scales in the water— it is detestable to you.
\p \v 13 And these you must detest among the birds and must not eat— they are detestable: the eagle, and the vulture, and the black vulture,\v 14 and the kite, and the falcon of any kind,\v 15 every raven of any kind,\v 16 and the ostrich, and the owl, and the seagull, and the hawk of any kind,\v 17 and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,\v 18 and the white owl, and the pelican, and the osprey,\v 19 and the stork, the heron of any kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.
\p \v 20 Every flying insect that walks on all fours— it is detestable to you.\v 21 Only this you may eat from all the flying insects that walk on all fours: what has jointed legs above its feet with which to hop on the ground.\v 22 These among them you may eat: the locust of any kind, and the bald locust of any kind, and the cricket of any kind, and the grasshopper of any kind.\v 23 But every flying insect that has four legs— it is detestable to you,
\p \v 24 and by these you will make yourself unclean. Any one who touches their carcasses will be unclean until the evening.\v 25 And any one who lifts up their carcasses must wash his clothes and will be unclean until the evening.\v 26 As for every animal which is one that divides the hoof but is not one that splits the cleft hoof, or is not one that chews the cud, they are unclean to you. Any one who touches them will be unclean.\v 27 As for any one that walks on its paws among all the animals that walk on all fours, they are unclean to you. Any one who touches their carcasses will be unclean until the evening.\v 28 And the one who lifts up their carcasses must wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening. These are unclean to you.
\p \v 29 And these are unclean to you among the swarming things that swarm on the ground: the weasel, and the mouse, and the large lizard of any kind,\v 30 and the gecko, and the monitor lizard, and the lizard, and the skink, and the chameleon.\v 31 These are unclean to you among all the swarming things. Any one who touches them when they are dead will be unclean until the evening.\v 32 And anything which upon one of them falls when they are dead will be unclean, whether any wood vessel, or a garment, or leather, or sackcloth— any object with which work is done must be put in water and be unclean until the evening. Then it will be clean.\v 33 As for any vessel of clay that one of them falls into, all that is inside it will become unclean, and you must destroy it.\v 34 Any food that may be eaten which such water comes on is unclean. And any liquid that may be drunk from any such vessel is unclean.\v 35 And all that something from one of their carcasses falls on becomes unclean; an oven or stove must be broken to pieces. They are unclean and they must remain unclean to you.\v 36 However, a spring or cistern for collecting water will be clean; but one who touches their carcass is unclean.\v 37 And if something from their carcass falls upon any seed for planting which will be planted, it is clean.\v 38 And if water is put on seed and something from their carcass falls on it, it is unclean to you.
\p \v 39 And if one from the animals that are for you to eat dies, the one who touches the carcass will be unclean until the evening.\v 40 And the one who eats from its carcass must wash his clothes and he will be unclean until the evening. And the one who lifts up its carcass will wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening.
\p \v 41 And every swarming thing that swarms on the ground, it is detestable and must not be eaten.\v 42 All that crawls on a belly, and all that walks on all fours, as well as all that has many feet— any swarming thing that swarms on the ground— you must not eat them for they are detestable.\v 43 You must not make yourselves detestable with any swarming thing that swarms. And you must not make yourselves unclean with them, and become unclean by them.\v 44 For I am Yahweh your God. And you must keep yourselves holy, and be holy ones, because I am holy. You must not make yourselves unclean with any swarming thing that crawls on the ground.\v 45 For I am Yahweh, who brought you out from the land of Egypt, to be your God. So you must be holy ones, for I am holy.
\p \v 46 This is the law of the animals, and the birds, and every living creature that swarms in the water, and of every creature that crawls on the ground,\v 47 to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean, and between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten.’”
\c 12
\p \v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 2 “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘If a woman bears seed and gives birth to a male child, then she will be unclean for seven days, as at the time of the bleeding of her menstruation she is unclean.\v 3 And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin must be circumcised.\v 4 And 30 days and 3 days she will stay in the blood of her purification. Any holy thing she must not touch and into the holy place she must not go until the days of her purification are completed.\v 5 And if she gives birth to a female child, then she will be unclean for two weeks, as with her menstruation. And 60 days and 6 days she will stay in the blood of her purification.
\p \v 6 And when the days of her purification are completed, for a son or for a daughter, she must bring a lamb, a son of its year, as a burnt offering, and a son of a pigeon or turtledove as a sin offering, to the entrance of the tent of meeting, to the priest.\v 7 And he will offer it before the face of Yahweh and make atonement for her. And she will be cleansed from the flow of her blood. This is the law for a woman who gives birth to a male or a female child.\v 8 And if her hand does not find enough for a lamb, then she must take two turtledoves or two sons of the pigeon, one as a burnt offering and one as a sin offering. And the priest will make atonement for her. Then she will be clean.’”
\c 13
\p \v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,\v 2 “When a human has on the skin of his body a swelling or scab or a bright spot, and it becomes an infection of skin disease on the skin of his body, then he must be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons, the priests.\v 3 And the priest will look at the infection on the skin of the body. If the hair in the infection has turned white, and if the disease appears to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is an infection of skin disease. And the priest will look at him and will pronounce him unclean.\v 4 And if the bright spot is white, it is on the skin of his body, and the appearance of it is not deeper than the skin, and its hair has not turned white, then the priest must isolate the infected person for seven days.\v 5 And the priest must look at him on the seventh day, and if the skin disease has stayed unchanged in his eyes and the skin disease has not spread on the skin, then the priest must isolate him for seven days again.\v 6 And the priest will look at him again on the seventh day, and if the infection has faded and the infection has not spread on the skin, then the priest will pronounce him clean. It is a rash, and he must wash his clothes, and then he will be clean.\v 7 And if the rash has spread further on the skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, then he must show himself again to the priest.\v 8 And the priest will look, and if the rash has spread on the skin, then the priest must pronounce him unclean. It is a skin disease.
\p \v 9 When an infection of skin disease is on a person, then he must be brought to the priest.\v 10 And the priest will look and if a white swelling is on the skin and it has turned the hair white, and there is new raw flesh in the swelling,\v 11 it is a chronic skin disease on the skin of his body, and the priest must pronounce him unclean. He will not isolate him, because he is unclean.\v 12 And if the skin disease breaks out further on the skin and the skin disease covers all the skin of the infected person from his head to his feet, as far as the appearance in the eyes of the priest,\v 13 then the priest must look, and if the skin disease has covered all his body, then he must pronounce the infected person clean. All of it has turned white. He is clean.\v 14 And when raw flesh appears on him, he will be unclean.\v 15 And the priest must look at the raw flesh and pronounce him unclean. The raw flesh— it is unclean. It is a skin disease.\v 16 Or if the raw flesh returns and changes to white, then he must go to the priest.\v 17 And the priest will look at him and if the infection has turned white, then the priest will pronounce the infected person clean. He is clean.
\p \v 18 When a body has a boil on it, on its skin, and it has healed,\v 19 and in place of the boil there is white swelling or a bright spot, reddish- white, then it must be shown to the priest.\v 20 And the priest will look and if it appears deeper under the skin, and its hair has turned white, then the priest must pronounce him unclean. It is an infection of skin disease. It has broken out in the boil.\v 21 And if the priest looks at it, and behold, there is no white hair on it, and it is not deeper than the skin, and it has faded, then the priest must isolate him for seven days.\v 22 And if it spreads further on the skin, then the priest must pronounce him unclean. It is an infection.\v 23 And if the bright spot stays in its place and has not spread, then it is the scar of the boil. And the priest must pronounce him clean.
\p \v 24 Or when the body has a burn from fire on its skin and the raw flesh of the burn has become a reddish- white or white spot,\v 25 then the priest will look at it. And if the hair has turned white in that spot, and it appears to be deeper than the skin, then it is a skin disease that has broken out in the burn. And the priest must pronounce him unclean. It is an infection of skin disease.\v 26 And if the priest looks at it and if there is no white hair in the spot, and it is not deeper than the skin but it has faded, then the priest must isolate him for seven days.\v 27 And the priest must look at him on the seventh day. If it has spread further in the skin, then the priest must pronounce him unclean. It is an infection of skin disease.\v 28 And if the bright spot stays in its place and has not spread in the skin but it has faded, then it is the swelling of the burn. And the priest must pronounce him clean, for it is the scar of the burn.
\p \v 29 And if a man or woman has an infection on him, on the head or in the beard,\v 30 then the priest must look at the infected person. And if it appears to be deeper than the skin, and on it is yellow, thin hair, then the priest must pronounce him unclean. It is an itch. It is a skin disease of the head or the beard.\v 31 And if the priest looks at the itching infection and if it does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, then the priest will isolate the person with the itching infection for seven days.\v 32 And the priest will look at the infection on the seventh day. And if the itch has not spread and there is no yellow hair on it, and there is no apperance of the itch deeper than the skin,\v 33 then he shave himself, but the itchy area must not be shaved. And the priest must isolate the itching person for seven days again.\v 34 And the priest will look at the itch on the seventh day. And if the itch has not spread on the skin and it appears to not be deeper than the skin, then the priest must pronounce him clean. And he must wash his clothes, and he will be clean.\v 35 And if the itch has spread further in the skin after he pronounced him clean,\v 36 then the priest must look at him. And if the itch has spread on the skin, the priest does not need to seek for yellow hair. He is unclean.\v 37 And if in his eyes the itch has stayed unchanged and black hair has grown in it, the itch has healed. He is clean, and the priest will pronounce him clean.
\p \v 38 And if a man or a woman has on the skin of their body bright spots, white bright spots,\v 39 then the priest must look. And if the bright spots on the skin of their body are a dull white, it is a rash that has broken out on the skin. He is clean.
\p \v 40 And if a man loses the hair of his head, he is bald. He is clean.\v 41 And if his head becomes bald from the front part of his face, he is bald. He is clean.\v 42 And if there is on the bald spot or on the bald forehead a reddish- white infection, it is a skin disease that has broken out on his bald spot or on his bald forehead.\v 43 And the priest must look at him. And if the swelling of the infection on his bald spot or on his forehead is reddish- white, like the appearance of the disease of the skin of the body,\v 44 then he is a man who has a skin disease. He is unclean. The priest must surely pronounce him unclean because of his infection of his head.
\p \v 45 As for the one with a skin disease who has the infection on him, his garments must be torn and his head must be unbound, and he must cover over the moustache, and he must call out, ‘Unclean, unclean.’\v 46 All the days that the infection is on him he will be unclean. He is unclean. He must live alone, his dwelling must be outside the camp.
\p \v 47 As for the garment, when it has in it the infection of skin disease, in a garment of wool or in a garment of linen,\v 48 or in warp or in woof of linen or wool, or in leather or in anything made with leather—\v 49 if the infection is greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the leather, or in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of leather, then it is an infection of skin disease. And it must be shown to the priest.\v 50 And the priest must look at the infection and he must isolate the infected thing for seven days.\v 51 And he must look at the infection on the seventh day. If the infection has spread in the garment or in the warp or in the woof, or in the leather (whatever the work for which the leather is used), then the infection is a malignant skin disease. It is unclean.\v 52 And he must burn the garment, or the warp or the woof, in wool or in linen, or any article of leather, whatever has in it the infection, for it is a malignant skin disease. In the fire it must be burned up.
\p \v 53 And if the priest looks, and behold, the infection has not spread in the garment or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any article of leather,\v 54 then the priest will command and they will wash that in which was the infection. And he must isolate it for seven days again.\v 55 And the priest will look at the infection after being washed. And if the infection has not changed its appearance, and the infection has not spread, it is unclean. In the fire you must burn it. It is an eaten away hole in its back or in its front.
\p \v 56 And if the priest looks, and behold, the infection has faded after it was washed, then he must tear it out from the garment or from the leather, or from the warp or from the woof.\v 57 And if it still appears in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of leather, it is spreading. In the fire you must burn it, the thing in which is the infection.\v 58 As for the garment or the warp or the woof, or any article of leather that you washed and the infection was removed from them, it must be washed a second time, and it will be clean.
\p \v 59 This is the law of the infection of skin disease of the garment of wool or linen, or the warp or the woof, or any article of leather, for pronouncing it clean or for pronouncing it unclean.”
\c 14
\p \v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 2 “This will be the law for the one with skin disease on the day of his cleansing. And he must be brought to the priest.\v 3 And the priest will go out to the outside of the camp and the priest will look. And if the infection of skin disease has healed in the one with skin disease,\v 4 then the priest will command and he must take for the one who is being cleansed two live, clean birds, and cedar wood, and crimson yarn, and hyssop.\v 5 And the priest will command and he will slaughter one bird in a vessel of clay over fresh water.\v 6 As for the live bird, he will take it and the cedar wood, and the crimson yarn and the hyssop, and he will dip them, and the live bird, in the blood of the bird that was slaughtered over the fresh water.\v 7 And he will sprinkle on the one who is to be cleansed from the skin disease seven times, and he will pronounce him clean. And he will release the living bird toward the face of the field.\v 8 And the one who is being cleansed will wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and bathe in the water, and then he will be clean. And afterward he will come into the camp, and he will dwell outside his tent seven days.\v 9 And it will be that on the seventh day he must shave off all his hair: his head, and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he must shave off. And he must wash his clothes and bathe his body in the water. And he will be clean.
\p \v 10 And on the eighth day he must take two male lambs without blemish, and one female lamb a year old without blemish, and three- tenths of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering mixed with oil, and one log of oil.\v 11 And the priest who pronounces one clean will set the person who is to be cleansed, and those things, before the face of Yahweh at the entrance of the tent of meeting.\v 12 And the priest will take one male lamb and offer it as a guilt offering, with the log of oil. And he will wave them as a wave offering before the face of Yahweh.\v 13 And he must slaughter the male lamb in the place where he slaughters the sin offering and the burnt offerings, in the holy place. For like the sin offering, so the guilt offering, it belongs to the priest. It is the holiest holy thing.\v 14 And the priest will take some of the blood of the guilt offering and the priest will put it on the tip of the right ear of the one who is being cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.\v 15 And the priest will take some of the log of oil and pour it on the left palm of the priest.\v 16 And the priest will dip his right finger in the oil that is on his left palm, and sprinkle some of the oil with his finger seven times before the face of Yahweh.\v 17 And the priest will put some of the rest of the oil that is on his palm on the tip of the right ear of the person being cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot— on top of the blood of the guilt offering.\v 18 As for the rest of the oil that is on the palm of the priest, he will put it on the head of the person being cleansed. And the priest will make atonement for him before the face of Yahweh.\v 19 And the priest will offer the sin offering and make atonement for the one being cleansed from his uncleanness. And afterward he will slaughter the burnt offering.\v 20 And the priest will offer up the burnt offering and the grain offering on the altar. And the priest will make atonement for him, and he will be clean.
\p \v 21 And if he is poor and his hand is not reaching, then he may take one male lamb as a guilt offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, and one- tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and a log of oil,\v 22 and two turtledoves or two sons of the pigeon, which his hand can reach. And one will be a sin offering and one a burnt offering.\v 23 And on the eighth day he must bring them for his cleansing to the priest, to the entrance of the tent of meeting, before the face of Yahweh.\v 24 And the priest will take the male lamb for the guilt offering and the log of oil. And the priest will wave them as a wave offering before the face of Yahweh.\v 25 And he must slaughter the male lamb for the guilt offering. And the priest will take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the tip of the right ear of the one being cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.\v 26 And the priest will pour some of the oil on the left palm of the priest.\v 27 And the priest will sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is on his left palm seven times before the face of Yahweh.\v 28 And the priest will put some of the oil that is on his palm on the tip of the right ear of the one being cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot— on the place of the blood of the guilt offering.\v 29 And the rest of the oil that is on the palm of the priest, he will put it on the head of the one being cleansed, to make atonement for him before the face of Yahweh.\v 30 And he must offer one from the turtledoves or from the sons of the pigeon, from what his hand could reach—\v 31 whatever his hand could reach, one as a sin offering and one as a burnt offering, with the grain offering. And the priest will make atonement for the one being cleansed before the face of Yahweh.\v 32 This is the law for someone in whom is an infection of skin disease, whose hand is not able to reach for his cleansing.”
\p \v 33 And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,\v 34 “When you have come into the land of Canaan which I gave to you as a possession, and I put an infection of skin disease in a house in the land of your possession,\v 35 then he to whom the house belongs must come and tell the priest, saying, ‘There seems to me to be something like an infection in the house.’\v 36 And the priest will command and they will empty the house before the priest comes to see the infection, so that all that is in the house will not be made unclean. And afterward the priest must come to see the house.\v 37 And he must look at the infection and if the infection in the walls of the house is greenish or reddish depressions and it appears to be deeper than the wall,\v 38 then the priest will go out of the house to the entrance of the house and close the house seven days.\v 39 And the priest will return on the seventh day and he will look and if the infection has spread in the walls of the house.\v 40 And the priest will command and they will take out the stones which have the infection on them and throw them to the outside of the city, to an unclean place.\v 41 And he will have the house scraped from around the house. And they must pour out the dirt that they scraped off at the outside of the city, at an unclean place.\v 42 And they must take other stones and put them in the place of the stones, and take other dirt and plaster the house.
\p \v 43 And if the infection returns and breaks out in the house after the stones have been pulled out and after the house has been scraped off and after the plastering,\v 44 then the priest must come and look. And if the infection has spread in the house, then it is a malignant infection in the house. It is unclean.\v 45 And the house must be torn down: its stones and its timber and all the plaster of the house. And he must take it away to the outside of the city, to an unclean place.\v 46 And the one who goes into the house during any of the days he has closed it will be unclean until the evening.\v 47 And the one who slept in the house must wash his clothes. And the one who ate in the house must wash his clothes.
\p \v 48 And if the priest comes again and looks, and behold, the infection has not spread in the house after the house was plastered, then the priest will pronounce the house clean, because the infection has healed.\v 49 And he must take two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet yarn, and hyssop to cleanse the house.\v 50 And he will slaughter one bird in a vessel of clay over fresh water.\v 51 And he will take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet yarn, and the live bird, and dip them in the blood of the bird that was slaughtered, and in the fresh water, and sprinkle on the house seven times.\v 52 And he will cleanse the house with the blood of the bird and with the fresh water, and with the live bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet yarn.\v 53 And he will release the live bird to the outside of the city, to the face of the field. And he will make atonement for the house, and it will be clean.
\p \v 54 This is the law for every infection of skin disease and for an itch,\v 55 and for the skin disease of clothing and for the house,\v 56 and for swelling, and for a rash, and for a bright spot,\v 57 to teach when it is unclean or when it is clean. This is the law for skin disease.”

\p \v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,\v 2 “Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, ‘When any man has a fluid discharge from his body, his fluid discharge makes him unclean.\v 3 And this is his uncleanness in his fluid discharge: whether his body lets his fluid discharge flow or his body obstructs the fluid discharge, it is his uncleanness.\v 4 Any bed on which the one with a fluid discharge lies will be unclean, and any thing on which he sits will be unclean.\v 5 And a man who touches his bed must wash his clothes and bathe in water, and he will be unclean until the evening;\v 6 And the one who sits on the thing on which the one with a fluid discharge sat must wash his clothes and bathe in water, and he will be unclean until the evening.\v 7 And the one who touches the body of the one with a fluid discharge must wash his clothes and bathe in water, and he will be unclean until the evening.\v 8 And if the one with a fluid discharge spits on someone who is clean, then he must wash his clothes and bathe in water, and he will be unclean until the evening.\v 9 And any saddle which the one with a fluid discharge rides upon will be unclean.\v 10 And any one who touches anything that was under him will be unclean until the evening. And the one who carries them must wash his clothes and bathe in water, and he will be unclean until the evening.\v 11 And anyone whom the one with a fluid discharge touches without having rinsed his hands in water, he must wash his clothes and bathe in water, and he will be unclean until the evening.\v 12 And a vessel of clay that the one with a fluid discharge touches must be broken, and every vessel of wood must be rinsed in water.
\p \v 13 And when the one with a fluid discharge becomes cleansed from his fluid discharge, then he must count for himself seven days for his cleansing. And he must wash his clothes and bathe his body in living water. And he will be clean.\v 14 And on the eighth day he must take for himself two turtledoves or two sons of the pigeon and come before the face of Yahweh at the entrance of the tent of meeting. And he must give them to the priest.\v 15 And the priest must offer them, one as a sin offering and one as a burnt offering. And the priest will make atonement for him before the face of Yahweh because of his fluid discharge.
\p \v 16 And if a man has an emission of seed go out from him, then he must bathe his whole body in water. And he will be unclean until the evening.\v 17 And any garment and any leather on which there is an emission of seed must be washed in water. And it will be unclean until the evening.\v 18 And if a man lies with a woman and there is an emission of seed, then they must bathe in water and be unclean until the evening.
\p \v 19 And when a woman has a fluid discharge, and blood is her fluid discharge in her body, for seven days she will be in her menstruation. And any one who touches her will be unclean until the evening.\v 20 And anything that she lies on during her menstruation will be unclean. And anything that she sits on will be unclean.\v 21 And any one who touches her bed must wash his clothes and bathe in water. And he will be unclean until the evening.\v 22 And any one who touches any thing that she sits on must wash his clothes and bathe in water. And he will be unclean until the evening.\v 23 And if it is on the bed or on a thing which she sits on, when he touches it, he will be unclean until the evening.\v 24 And if a man actually lies with her so that her menstrual impurity is on him, then he will be unclean for seven days; and every bed on which he lies will be unclean.
\p \v 25 And if a woman has a discharge of her blood that flows for many days when it is not the time of her menstruation, or if she discharges beyond her menstruation, all the days of the discharge of her uncleanness will be as the days of her menstruation. She is unclean.\v 26 Every bed on which she lies all the days of her discharge will be to her just like the bed of her menstruation. And any thing which she sits on will be unclean, just like the uncleanness of her menstruation.\v 27 And any one who touches them will be unclean; so he must wash his clothes and bathe in water, and he will be unclean until the evening.\v 28 And if she is cleansed from her discharge, then she will count for herself seven days, and after that she will be clean.\v 29 And on the eighth day she will take for herself two turtledoves or two sons of the pigeon and bring them to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting.\v 30 And the priest will offer one as a sin offering and one as a burnt offering. And the priest will make atonement for her before the face of Yahweh because of her unclean fluid discharge.
\p \v 31 And you must separate the sons of Israel from their uncleanness, and they will not die by their uncleanness, by their defiling my dwelling place that is in their midst.
\p \v 32 This is the law for the one who has a fluid discharge, and for whoever has an emission of seed go out from him by which to become unclean,\v 33 and for the one who is sick in her menstruation, and for the one who discharges his bodily fluid, whether male or female, and for a man who lies with an unclean woman.’”
\c 16
\p \v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they had come near to the face of Yahweh and died.\v 2 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Speak to Aaron your brother that he must not come at any time into the holy place inside the curtain, to the face of the atonement lid that is on the Box, so he does not die. For I appear in the cloud over the atonement lid.\v 3 In this manner Aaron must come into the holy place: with a bull, a son of the herd, for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.\v 4 He must put on the holy linen tunic, and the linen undergarments must be on his body, and he must tie the linen sash and wrap the linen turban— they are the holy garments. And he must bathe his body in water and then dress himself with them.\v 5 And from the assembly of the sons of Israel he must take two bucks of the goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering.
\p \v 6 And Aaron must offer the bull as the sin offering, which will be for himself. And he will make atonement for himself and for his house.\v 7 And he must take the two goats and set them before the face of Yahweh at the entrance of the tent of meeting.\v 8 And Aaron must cast lots on the two goats, one lot for Yahweh, and one lot for the goat that departs.\v 9 And Aaron must present the goat on which the lot fell for Yahweh, and he must offer it as a sin offering.\v 10 And the goat on which the lot fell for the goat that departs must be placed alive before the face of Yahweh, to make atonement on it by sending it away as a goat that departs into the wilderness.
\p \v 11 And Aaron must offer the bull of the sin offering, which will be for himself. And he will make atonement for himself and for his house. And he must slaughter the bull of the sin offering which is for himself.\v 12 And he must take a full censer of coals of fire from on the altar from before the face of Yahweh, and his two hands full of finely ground fragrant incense, and bring them inside the curtain.\v 13 And he must put the incense on the fire before the face of Yahweh. And the cloud of the incense will cover the atonement lid which is over the Testimony, and he will not die.\v 14 And he must take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the face of the atonement lid, on the east side. And before the face of the atonement lid he must sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times.
\p \v 15 And he must slaughter the goat of the sin offering that is for the people and bring its blood to inside the curtain. And he must do with the blood just as he did with the blood of the bull. And he must sprinkle it on the atonement lid and before the face of the atonement lid.\v 16 And he must make atonement for the holy place because of the uncleanness of the sons of Israel, and because of their rebellion, for all their sins. And thus he must do this for the tent of meeting that dwells with them in the midst of their uncleanness.\v 17 And any human must not be in the tent of meeting when he enters to make atonement in the holy place until he comes out and has made atonement for himself and for his house, and for all the assembly of Israel.\v 18 And he must go out to the altar that is before the face of Yahweh and make atonement for it. And he must take some of the blood of the bull and some of the blood of the goat and put it all around on the horns of the altar.\v 19 And he must sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times. And he will cleanse it and set it apart from the uncleanness of the sons of Israel.
\p \v 20 And when he has finished atoning for the holy place, and the tent of meeting, and the altar, then he must present the live goat.\v 21 And Aaron must lay his two hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the wickedness of the sons of Israel, and all their rebellion, for all their sins. And he must put them on the head of the goat and send it away by the hand of a man who is ready into the wilderness.\v 22 And the goat must carry on itself all their wickedness to a solitary land. And he will send the goat away in the wilderness.
\p \v 23 And Aaron must go into the tent of meeting and take off the linen garments that he had put on when he came to the holy place, and he must leave them there.\v 24 And he must bathe his body in water in a holy place, and put on his garments. And he must go out and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people. And he will make atonement for himself and for the people.\v 25 And the fat of the sin offering he must burn on the altar.\v 26 And the one who sent away the goat as a goat that departs must wash his clothes and bathe his body in water; and after that he may come into the camp.\v 27 And the bull of the sin offering and the goat of the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, must be brought out to the outside of the camp. Then they must burn in the fire their hides, and their flesh, and their dung.\v 28 And the one who burns them must wash his clothes and bathe his body in water; and after that he may come into the camp.
\p \v 29 And it will be a permanent statute for you, in the seventh month on the tenth day of the month, you must humble yourselves and must not do any work, the native born and the sojourner who sojourns among you;\v 30 for on this day atonement will be made for you, to cleanse you from all your sins. Before the face of Yahweh you will be clean.\v 31 It is a sabbath of solemn rest for you, and you must humble yourselves. It is a permanent statute.\v 32 And the priest must make atonement, he who anoints him and who fills his hand to be priest in place of his father, and he must put on the linen garments, the holy garments.\v 33 And he must make atonement for the holiest holy place. And he must make atonement for the tent of meeting and the altar. And he must make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.\v 34 This will be for you a permanent statute, to make atonement for the sons of Israel because of all their sins, once in the year.” And he did just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\c 17
\p \v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 2 “Speak to Aaron and to his sons, and to all the sons of Israel; and say to them this thing that Yahweh has commanded, saying,\v 3 ‘Any man from the house of Israel who slaughters an ox, or a lamb, or a goat in the camp, or who slaughters it outside of the camp,\v 4 but he does not bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to offer as an offering to Yahweh before the face of the dwelling of Yahweh— blood is reckoned to that man. He has shed blood, and that man must be cut off from among his people.\v 5 This is so that the sons of Israel will bring their sacrifices that they are sacrificing on the face of the field and bring them to Yahweh at the entrance of the tent of meeting, to the priest, and sacrifice the sacrifices of peace offerings to Yahweh with them.\v 6 And the priest will sprinkle the blood on the altar of Yahweh at the entrance of the tent of meeting. And he will burn the fat for a sweet aroma for Yahweh.\v 7 And they must no longer sacrifice their sacrifices to goat idols, whom they prostitute themselves after. This will be a permanent statute for them throughout their generations.’
\p \v 8 And you must say to them, ‘Any man from the house of Israel, or from the sojourners who sojourn among them, who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice\v 9 and does not bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting in order to offer it to Yahweh, that man must be cut off from his people.
\p \v 10 And any man from the house of Israel, or from the sojourners sojourning among them, who eats any blood, I will set my face against that person who eats the blood and I will cut him off from among his people.\v 11 For the life of the flesh is in its blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your lives. For it is the blood with the life that atones.\v 12 Therefore I said to the sons of Israel every person among you must not eat blood. And the sojourner who sojourns among you must not eat blood.\v 13 And any man from the sons of Israel, or from the sojourners sojourning among them, who hunts a wild game animal or bird that may be eaten, must pour out its blood and cover it with dirt.
\p \v 14 For the life of all flesh is its blood, it is with its life. And I have said to the sons of Israel, “You must not eat the blood of any flesh. For the life of all flesh— it is its blood. All who eat it must be cut off.”\v 15 And any person who eats an animal that has died or that has been torn by wild animals, among the native born or among the sojourners, he must wash his clothes and bathe in water, and he will be unclean until the evening. And he will be clean.\v 16 And if he does not wash or his body he does not bathe, then he must carry his iniquity.’”
\c 18
\p \v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 2 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘I am Yahweh your God.\v 3 Like the doings of the land of Egypt, in which you dwelled, you must not do. And like the doings of the land of Canaan which I am bringing you to, you must not do. You must not walk in their statutes.\v 4 My laws you must do, and my statutes you must keep, so that you walk in them. I am Yahweh your God.\v 5 And you must keep my statutes and my laws. The person who does them will live because of them. I am Yahweh.
\p \v 6 Any man must not come near to any relative of his body to uncover nakedness. I am Yahweh.\v 7 The nakedness of your father and the nakedness of your mother you must not uncover. She is your mother, you must not uncover her nakedness.\v 8 The nakedness of the wife of your father you must not uncover. It is the nakedness of your father.\v 9 The nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father or the daughter of your mother, born at home or born outside, you must not uncover their nakedness.\v 10 The nakedness of your son’s daughter or your daughter’s daughter, you must not uncover their nakedness, for they are your nakedness.\v 11 The nakedness of your father’s wife’s daughter, the offspring of your father, she is your sister. You must not uncover her nakedness.\v 12 The nakedness of your father’s sister you must not uncover. She is your father’s relative.\v 13 The nakedness of your mother’s sister you must not uncover, because she is your mother’s relative.\v 14 The nakedness of your father’s brother you must not uncover, to his wife you must not come near. She is your aunt.\v 15 The nakedness of your daughter- in- law you must not uncover. She is your son’s wife. You must not uncover her nakedness.\v 16 The nakedness of your brother’s wife you must not uncover. That is your brother’s nakedness.\v 17 The nakedness of a woman and her daughter you must not uncover. Her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter you must not take to uncover her nakedness. They are relatives. It is wickedness.\v 18 And a woman with her sister you must not take as a rival to uncover her nakedness in addition to her while she is alive.
\p \v 19 And you must not come near to a woman in the impurity of her uncleanness, to uncover her nakedness.\v 20 And you must not give your emission of seed to your neighbor’s wife, to become unclean with her.\v 21 And you must not give any of your children to cause to pass over to Molech. And you must not profane the name of your God. I am Yahweh.\v 22 And you must not lie with a male as one lies with a woman. That is detestable.\v 23 And with any animal you must not lie to become unclean by it. And a woman must not stand before the face of an animal to lie down with it. That is perversion.
\p \v 24 Do not make yourselves unclean in any of these ways, for in all these ways the nations that I will drive out from before your face have become unclean.\v 25 And the land became unclean, so I punished its sin upon it. And the land vomited out its inhabitants.\v 26 And you yourselves must keep my statutes and my laws. And you must not do any of these detestable things, neither the native- born nor the sojourner who sojourns among you\v 27 (for all these detestable things the men of the land have done, those who were before you, and the land has become unclean),\v 28 so the land does not vomit you out after you have made it unclean, just as it vomited out the nation that was before you.\v 29 Indeed, anyone who does any of these detestable things, the people who do such things will be cut off from among their people.\v 30 And you must keep my obligation not to do any of the detestable customs which were done before you, and not make yourselves unclean by them. I am Yahweh your God.’”
\c 19
\p \v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 2 “Speak to all the assembly of the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘You must be set apart ones, for I, Yahweh your God, am set apart.\v 3 A man must revere his mother and his father, and you must keep my sabbaths. I am Yahweh your God.\v 4 Do not turn to worthless idols, and do not make for yourselves gods out of metal. I am Yahweh your God.
\p \v 5 And when you sacrifice a sacrifice of peace offerings to Yahweh, you must sacrifice it for your acceptance.\v 6 On the day of your sacrifice it must be eaten, or on the next day, and what is left until the third day must be burned up in the fire.\v 7 And if it is eaten at all on the third day, it is unclean meat. It will not be accepted.\v 8 And the one who eats it must carry his iniquity because he has profaned the holy thing of Yahweh, and that person must be cut off from his people.
\p \v 9 And when you harvest the harvest of your land, you must not completely harvest the edge of your field, and you must not gather the gleaning of your harvest.\v 10 And you must not glean your vineyard, and you must not gather the fallen grapes of your vineyard. You must leave them for the poor and for the sojourner. I am Yahweh your God.
\p \v 11 You must not steal and you must not deceive and you must not lie, a man with his fellow citizen.\v 12 And you must not swear by my name falsely and profane the name of your God. I am Yahweh.
\p \v 13 You must not oppress your neighbor and you must not rob. The wages of a hired worker must not stay all night with you until morning.
\p \v 14 You must not curse the deaf and you must not put a stumbling block before the face of the blind. And you must fear your God. I am Yahweh.
\p \v 15 You must not do injustice in judgment. You must not lift up the face of the poor, and you must not give preference to the face of the great. In justice you must judge your neighbor.
\p \v 16 You must not walk around as a slanderer among your people. You must not stand against the blood of your neighbor. I am Yahweh.
\p \v 17 You must not hate your brother in your heart. You must surely rebuke your fellow citizen and not incur sin because of him.
\p \v 18 You must not take vengeance and you must not hold a grudge against the sons of your people, and you must love your neighbor as yourself. I am Yahweh.
\p \v 19 You must keep my statutes. You must not breed together your livestock of two different kinds. Your field you must not sow with two different kinds of seed, and a garment of two different kinds of material you must not put on you.
\p \v 20 And if a man lies with a woman so there is emission of seed and she is a slave who is promised to a man, and she has not been ransomed at all or freedom has not been given to her, there must be punishment. They must not be put to death because she was not free.
\p \v 21 And he must bring his guilt offering to Yahweh to the entrance of the tent of meeting— a ram as a guilt offering.\v 22 And the priest will make atonement for him with the ram for the guilt offering before the face of Yahweh, for the sin that he has sinned. And it will be forgiven him for his sin which he has sinned.
\p \v 23 And when you come into the land and have planted all kinds of trees for food, then you must regard its fruit as being uncircumcised in its foreskin. Three years it will be uncircumcised for you. It must not be eaten.\v 24 And in the fourth year all of its fruit will be holy, offerings of praise to Yahweh.\v 25 And in the fifth year you may eat its fruit, to increase its yield for you. I am Yahweh your God.
\p \v 26 You must not eat anything with the blood. You must not practice divination, and you must not interpret signs.\v 27 You must not round off the corners of your heads and you must not shave off the edge of your beard.
\p \v 28 And you must not make a cut on your body for the dead and you must not make on yourselves a mark of a tattoo. I am Yahweh.
\p \v 29 Do not profane your daughter by causing her to be a prostitute, and the land will not fall to prostitution and the land become full of wickedness.\v 30 My sabbaths you must keep and my holy place you must fear. I am Yahweh.
\p \v 31 Do not turn to the necromancers or to the soothsayers. Do not seek to become unclean by them. I am Yahweh your God.
\p \v 32 From the face of the gray- haired person you must rise and you must show respect in the face of an old person. You must fear your God. I am Yahweh.
\p \v 33 And if a sojourner sojourns among you in your land, you must not oppress him.\v 34 Like the native- born among you must be to you the sojourner who sojourns with you. And you must love him as yourself, because you were sojourners in the land of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.
\p \v 35 You must not do injustice in judgment, in measurement of length, in weight, or in quantity.\v 36 Just scales, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin you must have. I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out from the land of Egypt.\v 37 And you must keep all my statutes and all my laws, and you must do them. I am Yahweh.’”
\c 20
\p \v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 2 “And say to the sons of Israel, ‘Any man among the sons of Israel, or among the sojourners who sojourn in Israel who gives any of his offspring to Molech, must certainly be put to death. The people of the land must stone him with stones.\v 3 And I also will set my face against that man and I will cut him off from among his people. For he has given his offspring to Molech, so as to make my holy place unclean and to profane my holy name.\v 4 And if the people of the land cause their eyes to be hidden at all from that man when he gives his offspring to Molech, so as to not put him to death,\v 5 then I myself will set my face against that man and his clan. And I will cut him off and all the ones who prostitute themselves after him, by prostituting themselves after Molech, from the midst of their people.
\p \v 6 And the person who turns to the necromancers or to the soothsayers so as to prostitute themselves after them, I will set my face against that person. And I will cut him off from among his people.\v 7 So make yourselves holy and be holy ones, because I am Yahweh your God.
\p \v 8 And you must keep my statutes and do them. I am Yahweh who makes you holy.
\p \v 9 If there is any man who curses his father or his mother, he must surely be put to death. He has cursed his father or his mother, his blood is on him.
\p \v 10 And if a man commits adultery with a man’s wife, that is, he commits adultery with his neighbor’s wife, the adulterer and the adulteress must certainly be put to death.
\p \v 11 And if a man lies with his father’s wife, he uncovers his father’s nakedness. Both of them must certainly be put to death. Their blood is on them.\v 12 And if a man lies with his daughter- in- law, both of them must certainly be put to death. They have committed perversion; their blood is on them.
\p \v 13 And if a man lies with a male as one lies with a woman, both of them have done a detestable thing. They must surely be put to death; their blood is on them.
\p \v 14 And if a man takes a wife and her mother, this is wickedness. In the fire they must be burned, he and they, and there will not be wickedness among you.
\p \v 15 And if a man lies with an animal, he must surely be put to death, and you must kill the animal.
\p \v 16 And if a woman comes near to any animal to lie with it, then you must kill the woman and the animal. They must certainly be put to death; their blood is on them.
\p \v 17 And if a man takes his sister, a daughter of his father or a daughter of his mother, and he sees her nakedness, and she sees his nakedness, it is a shameful thing, and they must be cut off in the eyes of the sons of their people. He has uncovered the nakedness of his sister. He must bear his iniquity.
\p \v 18 And if a man lies with a menstruating woman and has uncovered her nakedness, he has exposed her flow and she has uncovered the flow of her blood. And both of them must be cut off from among their people.
\p \v 19 And the nakedness of your mother’s sister, or your father’s sister, you must not uncover because he would expose his relative. They must bear their iniquity.
\p \v 20 And if a man lies with his aunt, he has uncovered his uncle’s nakedness. They will bear their sin; they will die childless.
\p \v 21 And if a man takes his brother’s wife, that is disgraceful. He has uncovered the nakedness of his brother; they will be childless.
\p \v 22 And you must keep all my statutes and all my judgments, and you must do them, and the land which I am bringing you there to dwell in will not vomit you out.
\p \v 23 And you must not walk in the statutes of the nations that I will drive out from before your face. For they have done all these things, and I detest them.
\p \v 24 And I said to you, “You will possess their land and I will give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey. I am Yahweh your God, who has separated you from the peoples.\v 25 And you must distinguish between the clean animal and the unclean, and between the unclean bird and the clean. And you must not make yourselves detestable by an animal or by a bird or by anything that crawls on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.
\p \v 26 And you must be holy ones for me, because I, Yahweh, am holy, and I have separated you from the peoples to be mine.
\p \v 27 And if there is among them a man or woman necromancer or soothsayer, they must certainly be put to death. They must stone them with stones. Their blood is on them.’”

\p \v 1 And Yahweh said to Moses: “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them, ‘For a dead person he must not make himself unclean among his people.\v 2 But if for his relative close to him— for his mother, or for his father, or for his son, or for his daughter, or for his brother,\v 3 or for his virgin sister who is close to him since she has no husband, for her he may make himself unclean.\v 4 He must not make himself unclean as a husband among his people, to profane himself.
\p \v 5 They must not shave a bald patch on their heads and they must not shave off the corner of their beard, and they must not cut a cut in their flesh.\v 6 They must be holy ones to their God and they must not profane the name of their God. For they are offering Yahweh’s offerings made by fire, the bread of their God, so they must be holy.\v 7 He must not take a woman who is a prostitute or profaned. And he must not take a woman divorced from her husband. For he is holy to his God.
\p \v 8 And you will make him holy, for he is the one who offers the bread of your God. He must be holy for you, because I, Yahweh who makes you holy, am holy.
\p \v 9 And a daughter of any priest who profanes herself by becoming a prostitute, she is profaning her father. In the fire she must be burned.
\p \v 10 And the great priest among his brothers, who has had the oil of anointing poured upon his head and has had his hand filled to wear the garments, he must not let his head be unbound and he must not tear his clothes.\v 11 And he must not go near any dead person, for his father or for his mother. He must not make himself unclean.\v 12 And he must not leave from the holy place and he must not profane the holy place of his God. For the dedication of the oil of the anointing of his God is upon him. I am Yahweh.
\p \v 13 And he must take a wife in her virginity.\v 14 A widow, or a divorced woman, or a profaned prostitute— these he must not take. But rather, a virgin from his people he must take as a wife.\v 15 And he will not profane his offspring among his people. For I am Yahweh who makes him holy.’”
\p \v 16 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 17 “Speak to Aaron, saying, ‘A man from your offspring throughout their generations who has a defect in him must not come near to offer food to his God.\v 18 For any man who has in him a defect must not come near: a man blind or lame or who has a slit nose or who is deformed,\v 19 or a man who has a broken foot or a broken hand,\v 20 or a hunchback, or a dwarf, or one with a defect in his eye or eczema or scabs or a crushed testicle.\v 21 Any man who has in him a defect among the offspring of Aaron the priest must not approach to offer Yahweh’s offerings made by fire. A defect is in him. He must not approach to offer the bread of his God.\v 22 The food of his God, some of the holiest holy things and some of the holy things, he may eat.\v 23 However, he must not go into the curtain and he must not approach to the altar. For a defect is in him and he must not profane my holy place. For I am Yahweh who makes them holy.’”\v 24 And Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel.
\c 22
\p \v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 2 “Say to Aaron and to his sons that they must deal respectfully with the holy things of the sons of Israel, which they dedicate to me. And they must not profane my holy name. I am Yahweh.\v 3 Say to them, ‘Throughout your generations any man from all your seed who comes near to the holy things that the sons of Israel have made holy to Yahweh and his uncleanness is upon him, that person must be cut off from before my face. I am Yahweh.
\p \v 4 Any man from the seed of Aaron who is one with a skin disease or a fluid discharge, he must not eat of the holy things until he becomes clean. And the one who touches anything unclean of a corpse, or a man who has go out from him an emission of seed,\v 5 or a man who touches any swarming thing that makes him unclean, or a person who makes him unclean, whatever his uncleanness—\v 6 the person who touches it will be unclean until the evening. And he must not eat from the holy things, unless he has bathed his body in water.
\p \v 7 And when the sun has set, then he will be clean. And afterward he may eat from the holy things, because it is his food.\v 8 He must not eat an animal found dead or killed by wild animals, to become unclean by it. I am Yahweh.
\p \v 9 And they must keep my obligations, and they will not bear sin because of it and die by it, because they profaned it. I am Yahweh who makes them holy.
\p \v 10 And any stranger may not eat the holy thing. A foreign guest of the priest or a hired worker may not eat the holy thing.\v 11 And if a priest buys a person as property with his silver— he may eat it, and a descendant of his house, they may eat his food.
\p \v 12 And if a priest’s daughter becomes the wife of a stranger, she may not eat the contributions of the holy things.\v 13 And if the daughter of a priest becomes a widow, or divorced, and there is no offspring for her, and she returns to her father’s house as in her youth, she may eat from the food of her father. And any stranger may not eat it.
\p \v 14 And if a man eats a holy thing by mistake, then he must add its fifth on it and give the holy thing to the priest.\v 15 And they must not profane the holy things of the sons of Israel that they lifted up to Yahweh,\v 16 and cause themselves to bear the guilt of the guilt offering by their eating their holy things. For I am Yahweh who makes them holy.’”
\p \v 17 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 18 “Speak to Aaron and to his sons, and to all the sons of Israel, and say to them, ‘Any man from the house of Israel, or from the sojourners in Israel, who offers his offering, for any of their vows or for any of their freewill offerings, which they present to Yahweh as a burnt offering,\v 19 for your acceptance, it must be a male without blemish from the cattle, from the sheep, or from the goats.\v 20 Anything that has a blemish on it you must not offer, because it will not be acceptable for you.
\p \v 21 And when a man offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to Yahweh to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering from the herd or from the flock, it must be unblemished to be accepted. There must not be any defect in it.\v 22 The blind, or disabled, or maimed, or that have warts, or eczema, or scabs— these you must not offer to Yahweh. And you must not give from them an offering made by fire on the altar to Yahweh.\v 23 An ox or a lamb that is deformed or stunted— it you may offer as a freewill offering, but for a vow it will not be accepted.
\p \v 24 One that is bruised, or crushed, or torn, or has cut testicles you must not offer to Yahweh, and in your land you must not do so.\v 25 And from the hand of the son of a foreigner you must not offer the food of your God from any of these because their deformity is in them and a defect is in them. They will not be accepted for you.’”
\p \v 26 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 27 “When an ox or a sheep or a goat is born, it must remain seven days with its mother. And from the eighth day and beyond, it may be accepted as an offering, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
\p \v 28 And an ox or a sheep, it and its young you must not slaughter on the same day.\v 29 And when you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanks to Yahweh, you must sacrifice it for your acceptance.\v 30 On that day it must be eaten, you must not leave part of it until morning. I am Yahweh.
\p \v 31 And you must keep my commandments and you must do them. I am Yahweh.
\p \v 32 And you must not profane my holy name. I must be treated as holy in the midst of the sons of Israel. I am Yahweh who sets you apart,\v 33 who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I am Yahweh.”
\c 23
\p \v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 2 “Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, ‘These are the appointed times of Yahweh, which you must proclaim as holy assemblies. They are my appointed times.\v 3 Six days work will be done, and on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, a holy assembly. You must not do any work. It is a sabbath for Yahweh in all your dwellings.
\p \v 4 These are the appointed times of Yahweh, the holy assemblies, them which you must announce at their appointed times:\v 5 In the first month, on day 14 of the month, between the evenings, is Yahweh’s Passover.\v 6 And on day 15 of this month is the Festival of Unleavened Bread for Yahweh. Seven days you must eat unleavened bread.\v 7 On the first day there will be a holy assembly for you. You must not do any work of labor.\v 8 And you will offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh for seven days. On day seven is a holy assembly. You must not do any work of labor.’”
\p \v 9 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 10 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you have come into the land that I am giving to you, and you harvest its harvest, then you must bring a sheaf of the first of your harvest to the priest.\v 11 And he will wave the sheaf before the face of Yahweh to be accepted for you. On the day after the sabbath the priest must wave it.\v 12 And you must offer, on the day when you wave the sheaf, a male lamb, one year old, without blemish as a burnt offering to Yahweh.\v 13 And its grain offering must be two- tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as an offering made by fire to Yahweh, a sweet aroma, and its drink offering, a fourth of a hin of wine.\v 14 And bread, and roasted grain and fresh grain you must not eat until this very day, until your offering of the offering of your God. It is a permanent statute throughout your generations, in all your dwellings.
\p \v 15 And you will count for yourselves from the day after the sabbath— from the day of your bringing the sheaf of the wave offering— there will be seven full sabbaths.\v 16 Until the day after the seventh sabbath you must count 50 days. And you must offer an offering of new grain to Yahweh.\v 17 From your dwellings you must bring bread for a wave offering. They must be two loaves of two- tenths of an ephah of fine flour. They must be baked with yeast as firstfruits to Yahweh.\v 18 And you must offer with the bread seven male lambs without defects, sons of the year, and one bull, a son of the herd, and two rams. They must be a burnt offering to Yahweh, with their grain offering and their drink offerings, an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma for Yahweh.\v 19 And you must offer one buck of the goats for a sin offering, and two male lambs, sons of the year, for a sacrifice of peace offerings.\v 20 And the priest must wave them with the bread of the firstfruits wave offering before the face of Yahweh with the two lambs. They will be set apart to Yahweh for the priest.\v 21 And you must make a proclamation on that very day. There will be a holy assembly for you. You must not do any work of labor. It is a permanent statute in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
\p \v 22 And when you harvest the harvest of your land, you must not finish the edge of your field as you harvest, and you must not gather the gleaning of your harvest. You must leave them for the poor and for the sojourner. I am Yahweh your God.’”
\p \v 23 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 24 “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘In the seventh month, on day one of the month there will be for you a solemn rest, a memorial by trumpet blast, a holy assembly.\v 25 You must not do any work of labor, and you must offer a sacrifice made by fire to Yahweh.’”\v 26 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 27 “Surely on day 10 of this seventh month it is the Day of Atonement. It will be a holy assembly for you, and you must humble yourselves and offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh.\v 28 And you must not do any work on that very day because it is the Day of Atonement, to make atonement for yourselves before the face of Yahweh your God.\v 29 If there is any person who does not humble himself on that very day, then he must be cut off from his people.\v 30 And any person who does any work on that very day, I will destroy that person from among his people.\v 31 You must not do any work. It is a permanent statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings.\v 32 It is a sabbath of solemn rest for you, and you must humble yourselves on day nine of the month in the evening. From evening until evening you are to observe your sabbath.”
\p \v 33 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 34 “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘On day 15 of the seventh month this is the Festival of Huts for seven days to Yahweh.\v 35 On the first day there must be a holy assembly. You must not do any work of labor.\v 36 Seven days you must offer a sacrifice made by fire to Yahweh. On the eighth day there must be a holy assembly for you, and you must offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh. It is a solemn assembly. You must not do any work of labor.\v 37 These are the appointed times of Yahweh, which you must proclaim as holy assemblies to offer a sacrifice made by fire to Yahweh, a burnt offering and a grain offering, sacrifices and drink offerings, each day’s matter on its day,\v 38 apart from the sabbaths of Yahweh, and apart from your gifts, and apart from all your vows, and apart from all your freewill offerings that you give to Yahweh.
\p \v 39 Surely on day 15 of the seventh month when you have gathered the produce of the land, you must celebrate a festival of Yahweh for seven days, on the first day a solemn rest, and on the eighth day a solemn rest.\v 40 And you must take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of the majestic trees, branches of palm trees, and branches of leafy trees, and willows of the stream. And you will rejoice before the face of Yahweh your God seven days.\v 41 And you must celebrate it as a festival for Yahweh seven days in the year. It is a permanent statute throughout your generations in the seventh month you must celebrate it.\v 42 In the huts you must live for seven days. All the native- born in Israel must live in the huts,\v 43 so that your generations may know that I made the sons of Israel live in the huts when I brought them from the land of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.’”\v 44 And Moses announced the appointed times of Yahweh to the sons of Israel.
\c 24
\p \v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 2 “Command the sons of Israel and they will bring to you pure beaten oil of the olive for the light, so the lamp may burn continually.\v 3 Outside the curtain of the testimony in the tent of meeting, Aaron must keep it in order, from evening until morning, before the face of Yahweh continually. It is a permanent statute throughout your generations.\v 4 On the pure gold lampstand he must keep the lamps in order before the face of Yahweh continually.
\p \v 5 And you must take fine flour and bake 12 cakes with it. There must be two- tenths of an ephah in one cake.\v 6 And you must set them in two rows, six in a row, on the pure gold table before the face of Yahweh.\v 7 And you must put on the row pure incense and it will be a memorial portion for the bread, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.\v 8 On the day of the sabbath, every sabbath, he must keep it in order before the face of Yahweh continually. It is from the sons of Israel as an eternal covenant.\v 9 And it will be for Aaron and for his sons, and they must eat it in a holy place. For it is a holiest holy thing for him, from Yahweh’s offerings made by fire, a perpetual portion.”\v 10 Now the son of an Israelite woman, who was also the son of an Egyptian man, went out in the midst of the sons of Israel. And the son of the Israelite woman and an Israelite man fought in the camp.\v 11 And the son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name and cursed, and they brought him to Moses. (Now his mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)\v 12 And they caused him to remain in the guard- post until it would be made clear to them what was in accordance with the mouth of Yahweh.
\p \v 13 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 14 “Bring out the one who has cursed to the outside of the camp. And all the hearers must lay their hands on his head, and all the assembly must stone him.\v 15 And speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘If any man curses his God, then he must bear his sin.\v 16 And he who blasphemes the name of Yahweh must surely be put to death. All the assembly must certainly stone him, as the sojouner so the native- born. When he blasphemes the Name, he must be put to death.\v 17 And if a man strikes dead any human being, he must certainly be put to death.\v 18 And he who strikes dead the life of an animal must repay it, life in place of life.\v 19 And if a man gives an injury to his fellow citizen, as he has done so it will be done to him:\v 20 fracture in place of fracture, eye in place of eye, tooth in place of tooth. As he gave an injury to a human, so it must be given to him.\v 21 And he who strikes dead an animal must repay it. And he who strikes dead a human must be put to death.\v 22 There must be one law for you, as the sojourner so will be the native- born. For I am Yahweh your God.’”\v 23 And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, and they brought the one who had cursed to the outside of the camp. And they stoned him with stones, and the sons of Israel did as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\c 25
\p \v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying,\v 2 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you come to the land that I am giving to you, then the land must keep a sabbath, a sabbath for Yahweh.\v 3 Six years you must plant your field, and six years you must prune your vineyard and gather its produce.\v 4 And in the seventh year, there must be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath for Yahweh. You must not plant your field and you must not prune your vineyard.\v 5 You must not harvest the second growth of your harvest and you must not gather the grapes of your unpruned vines. It will be a year of solemn rest for the land.\v 6 And the sabbath of the land will be for you, as food for you, and for your male slave, and for your female slave, and for your hired servant, and for the foriegn resident who is sojourning with you,\v 7 and for your livestock and for the wild animal that is in your land, all its yield will be for eating.
\p \v 8 And you must count for yourself seven sabbaths of years, seven times seven years, and there will be for you a period of seven sabbaths of years, 49 years.\v 9 And you must cause the horn blast to be heard on the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month. On the Day of Atonement you must cause the horn to be heard throughout all your land.\v 10 And you must set apart the year, year 50, and proclaim freedom in the land to all its inhabitants. It will be a jubilee for you and you must return a man to his property and you must return a man to his family.\v 11 That year, year 50, will be a jubilee for you. You must not plant and not harvest its second growth and not harvest its unpruned vines.\v 12 For it is a jubilee, it will be holy for you. You must eat its yield from the field.
\p \v 13 In this Year of Jubilee you must return a man to his property.\v 14 And if you sell something sold to your fellow citizen or buy from the hand of your fellow citizen, a man must not oppress his brother.\v 15 According to the number of years after the jubilee you must buy from your fellow citizen. According to the number of years of yield he must sell to you.\v 16 According to the multitude of the years you must increase its purchase price, but according to the fewness of the years you must decrease its purchase price, because of the number of yields he is selling to you.\v 17 And you must not oppress, a man his fellow citizen. And you must fear your God, for I am Yahweh your God.
\p \v 18 And you must do my statutes, and my laws you must keep and do them. And you will dwell on the land securely.\v 19 And the land will give its fruit, and you will eat to satisfaction and dwell securely on it.\v 20 And if you say, “What will we eat in the seventh year? Look, we cannot plant and we cannot gather our yield.”\v 21 Then I will command my blessing for you in the sixth year, and it will produce yield for three years.\v 22 And you will plant in the eighth year and you will eat from the old yield until the ninth year, until its yield comes in you will eat the old.\v 23 And the land must not be sold for perpetuity, for the land belongs to me. For you are sojourners and temporary residents with me.\v 24 And in all the land of your possession you must give redemption for the land.\v 25 If your brother becomes poor and sells some of his property, then his redeemer nearest to him may come and redeem the things sold of his brother.\v 26 And if a man does not have a redeemer for it, but his hand produces and he finds enough for its redemption,\v 27 then he may calculate the years of its sale and return the balance to the man whom he sold it to. And he may return to his property.\v 28 And if his hand does not find enough to get it back for himself, then his sold things will remain in the hand of he who bought it until the Year of Jubilee. And it will go out in the Jubilee and he will return to his property.
\p \v 29 And if a man sells a residential house of a walled city, then his right of redemption will be until the completion of the year of its sale. It will be the days of his right of redemption.\v 30 And if it is not redeemed for him up to the fulfilling of an entire year, then the house which is in the city which has its wall will belong in perpetuity to him who bought it and to his descendants. It will not go out in the Jubilee.\v 31 And the houses of the villages that have no wall around them will be considered as the field of the land. There will be redemption for it, and in the Jubilee it will go out.\v 32 As for the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, the right of redemption is permanent for the Levites.\v 33 And whatever is from the Levites he may redeem, and a sold house or a city of his posession will go out in the Jubilee. For the houses of the cities of the Levites— it is their possession among the sons of Israel.\v 34 And the field of the pastureland of their cities must not be sold because it is their permanent possession.
\p \v 35 And if your brother becomes poor and his hand is shaky with you, then you must support him as a sojourner or temporary resident and he will live with you.\v 36 Do not take from him interest or usury, and you must fear your God and your brother may live with you.\v 37 Your silver you must not give to him with interest and for profit you must not give your food.\v 38 I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out from the land of Egypt to give to you the land of Canaan, to be your God.
\p \v 39 And if your brother with you becomes poor and is sold to you, you must not make him work the work of a slave.\v 40 Like a hired worker, like a temporary resident, he must be with you. Until the Year of Jubilee he will serve with you.\v 41 And he will go away from you, he and his sons with him, and he will return to his clan. And he will return to the possession of his fathers.\v 42 For they are my servants, them which I brought out of the land of Egypt. They will not be sold in a slave sale.\v 43 You must not rule over him with ruthlessness, and you must fear your God.\v 44 As for your male slave and your female slave who you have for yourself, from the nations that surround you, from them you may acquire a male slave or a female slave.\v 45 And also from the sons of the sojourners who are dwelling with you, from them you may acquire, and from their clans who are with you, who have given birth in your land— they may become your property.\v 46 And you may bequeath them to your sons after you, to inherit as a possession, you may let them work permanently. But as for your brothers, the sons of Israel, a man with his brother, you must not rule over him with ruthlessness.
\p \v 47 And if the hand of a sojourner or a temporary resident with you has produced, and your brother with you becomes poor and is sold to a sojourner, a temporary resident with you, or to a descendant of a clan of a sojourner,\v 48 after he has been sold, there will be redemption for him. One of his brothers may redeem him,\v 49 or his uncle, or the son of his uncle may redeem him; or a relative of his flesh from his clan may redeem him. Or, if his hand has produced, then he may redeem himself.\v 50 And he will calculate with his buyer from the year he was sold to him until the Year of Jubilee, and the silver of his sale must be according to the number of years; like the days of a hired worker it will be with him.\v 51 If there are still many of the years, according to them he must pay back his redemption from the silver of his purchase.\v 52 And if a few of the years until the Year of Jubilee are left, then he must calculate for him according to his years. He must pay back his redemption.\v 53 Like a hired worker year by year he will be with him. He must not rule over him with ruthlessness in your eyes.\v 54 And if he is not redeemed by these, then he must go out in the Year of Jubilee, he and his sons with him.\v 55 For to me the sons of Israel are servants. They are my servants, them which I brought out of the land of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.’”

\p \v 1 “You must not make for yourselves idols. And a carved figure or a stone pillar you must not lift up for yourselves, and a stone sculpture you must not put in your land to bow down in front of it. For I am Yahweh your God.\v 2 My sabbaths you must keep and my holy place you must fear. I am Yahweh.
\p \v 3 If you walk in my statutes and keep my commandments and do them,\v 4 then I will give your rain in its season. And the land will give its yield, and the tree of the field will give its fruit.\v 5 And your threshing season will reach the grape harvest, and the grape harvest will reach the planting season. And you will eat your bread to satisfaction and dwell securely in your land.\v 6 And I will give peace in the land. And you will lie down and there will be nothing that makes one afraid. And I will remove the harmful animals from the land, and the sword will not pass through your land.\v 7 And you will pursue those who are hostile to you, and they will fall before your face by the sword.\v 8 And five from you will pursue a hundred, and a hundred from you will pursue ten thousand. And those who are hostile to you will fall before your face by the sword.\v 9 And I will turn to you and make you fruitful and multiply you. And I will establish my covenant with you.\v 10 And you will eat the old that has grown old and the old you will bring out from the face of the new.\v 11 And I will put my holy place in the midst of you, and my spirit will not detest you.\v 12 And I will walk in the midst of you and I will be your God, and you will be my people.\v 13 I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out from the land of Egypt, from being their slaves. And I broke the bars of your yoke and made you to walk upright.
\p \v 14 And if you will not listen to me, and will not do all these commandments,\v 15 and if you reject my statutes and if your spirit detests my laws, so as to not do all my commandments, so that you break my covenant—\v 16 then surely I will do this to you: I will inflict terror on you, consumption and fever that destroys the eyes and drains away life. And you will sow your seed for nothing, because those who are hostile to you will eat it.\v 17 And I will set my face against you, and you will be defeated in the face of those who are hostile to you. And those who hate you will rule over you; and you will flee, though there is not one who chases you.\v 18 And if up to these you do not listen to me, then I will continue to discipline you seven times for your sins.\v 19 And I will break the pride of your power. And I will make your sky like iron and your land like bronze.\v 20 And your strength will be used up for nothing, because your land will not give its yield. And the tree of the land will not give its fruit.
\p \v 21 And if you walk against me in opposition and are not willing to listen to me, then I will add upon you a plague seven times, according to your sins.\v 22 And I will send forth among you animals of the field, and they will make you childless, and destroy your livestock, and make you few in number. And your roads will become deserted.
\p \v 23 And if in spite of these things you do not accept my discpline and you walk against me in opposition,\v 24 then I will also walk, I myself, against you in opposition. And I will strike you, even I myself, seven times because of your sins.\v 25 And I will bring a sword upon you that will avenge with the vengeance of the covenant, and you will be gathered into your cities. And I will send a plague in the midst of you, and you will be given into the hand of the one who is hostile.\v 26 When I break the staff of your bread, then ten women will bake your bread in one oven. And they will distribute your bread by weight, and you will eat but not be satisfied.
\p \v 27 And if in spite of this you do not listen to me, and you walk against me in opposition,\v 28 then I will walk against you in the wrath of opposition. And I will discipline you, even I, seven times for your sins.\v 29 And you will eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters you will eat.\v 30 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your incense altars, and put your corpses on the corpses of your idols, and I myself will abhor you.\v 31 And I will lay your cities in ruins and make your holy places desolate. And I will not smell your sweet aromas.\v 32 And I myself will make the land desolate, and those who are hostile to you who dwell in it will be shocked at it.\v 33 And I will scatter you among the nations, and I will unsheathe a sword behind you. And your land will be desolate, and your cities will be ruined.
\p \v 34 Then the land will enjoy its sabbaths all the days of its desolation while you are in the land of those who are hostile to you. Then the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths.\v 35 All the days of its desolation it will rest what it did not rest on your sabbaths when you lived on it.
\p \v 36 As for the ones who are remaining among you, I will bring despair into their hearts in the land of those who are hostile to them, and the sound of a windblown leaf will chase them. And they will flee as one fleeing from a sword, and you will fall though there is not one who chases.\v 37 And you will stumble, each over his brother, as from the face of a sword, though there is not one who chases. And you will have no power to stand to the face of those who are hostile to you.\v 38 And you will perish among the nations, and the land of those who are hostile to you will devour you.\v 39 And the ones who are remaining among you will rot in their iniquity, in the lands of those who are hostile to you. And also in the iniquities of their fathers they will rot with them.
\p \v 40 And if they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers, in their unfaithfulness which they acted unfaithfully against me, and also that they walked against me in opposition—\v 41 also I myself went against them in opposition and I brought them into the land of those who are hostile to them— if then their uncircumcised hearts become humbled, and then they pay for their iniquity,\v 42 then I will remember my covenant with Jacob. And also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham I will remember. And I will remember the land.\v 43 And the land was abandoned by them, and it will rejoice with its sabbaths while being desolate without them. And they themselves will pay for their iniquity because they rejected my judgments and their spirit detested my statutes.\v 44 And despite even this, when they are in the land of those who are hostile to them, I will not reject them, and I will not detest them so as to destroy them, to break my covenant with them. For I am Yahweh their God.\v 45 And I will remember for their sake the covenant with their ancestors, them whom I brought out from the land of Egypt in the eyes of the nations, to be their God. I am Yahweh.”
\p \v 46 These are the statutes, and the judgments, and the instructions that Yahweh made between himself and between the sons of Israel at Mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.
\c 27
\p \v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\v 2 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘If a man vows a vow according to your valuation of persons to Yahweh,\v 3 then your valuation will be for a male from a son of 20 years and up to a son of 60 years and your valuation must be 50 shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the holy place.\v 4 And if she is a female, then your valuation must be 30 shekels.\v 5 And if from a son of five years and up to a son of 20 years, then your valuation for the male must be 20 shekels, and for the female ten shekels.\v 6 And if from a son of a month and up to a son of five years, then your valuation for the male must be five shekels of silver, and for the female your valuation of three shekels of silver.\v 7 And if from a son of 60 years and up, if a male, then your valuation must be 15 shekels, and for the female ten shekels.\v 8 And if he is poorer than your valuation, then he must present himself to the face of the priest, and the priest will value him. According to what the hand of the one making the vow produces the priest will value him.
\p \v 9 And if it is an animal from which they offer an offering to Yahweh, all that he gives from them to Yahweh will be set apart.\v 10 He must not replace it and he must not exchange it, a good one for a bad one or a bad for a good. And if he exchanges at all an animal for an animal, then it will be and the exchanged one will be set apart.\v 11 And if any animal is unclean from which an offering must not be offered to Yahweh, then he must present the animal to the face of the priest.\v 12 And the priest will set its value as either good or bad. According to the valuation of you, the priest, thus will it be.\v 13 And if he ever redeems it, then he must add its fifth in addition to your valuation.
\p \v 14 And when a man sets apart his house as a holy thing to Yahweh, then the priest will set its value as either good or bad. As the priest values it, so it will stand.\v 15 And if the one who set it apart redeems his house, then he must add a fifth of the silver of your valuation to it, and it will belong to him.
\p \v 16 And if a man sets apart part of the field of his property to Yahweh, then your valuation will be in proportion to its seed— a homer of barley seed for 50 shekels of silver.\v 17 If he sets apart his field during the Year of Jubilee, according to your valuation it will stand.\v 18 And if he sets apart his field after the Jubilee, then the priest must calculate for it the silver according to the years remaining until the Year of Jubilee, and it must be reduced from your valuation.\v 19 And if he who set it apart ever redeems the field, then he must add a fifth of the silver of your valuation to it, and it will belong to him.\v 20 And if he does not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it cannot be redeemed again.\v 21 And the field will be, when it goes out in the Jubilee, a holy thing to Yahweh, like the field that has been dedicated by ban. It will belong to the priest as his property.\v 22 And if he sets apart to Yahweh a field of his acquisition that is not part of the field of his property,\v 23 then the priest will calculate for him the amount of your valuation up to the Year of Jubilee, and the man must give your valuation on that day as a holy thing to Yahweh.\v 24 In the Year of Jubilee, the field will return to whom he bought it from, to whom belongs the posession of the land.\v 25 And all your valuations must be by the shekel of the holy place; 20 gerahs must be the shekel.
\p \v 26 Surely the firstborn which belongs as firstborn to Yahweh among animals, a man must not set it apart. Whether ox or sheep, it belongs to Yahweh.\v 27 And if it is among the unclean animals, then he may buy it back according to your valuation, and he must add its fifth to it. And if it is not redeemed, then it will be sold at your valuation.
\p \v 28 Surely any dedicated thing that a man dedicates to Yahweh, from all that belongs to him, from human or animal, or from the field of his property, must not be sold and must not be redeemed. Every dedicated thing, it is the holiest holy thing to Yahweh.\v 29 Every dedicated one who is dedicated from mankind must not be ransomed. He must surely be put to death.
\p \v 30 And all the tithe of the land, from the seed of the land and from the fruit of the tree, belongs to Yahweh. It is holy to Yahweh.\v 31 And if a man ever redeems some of his tenth, he must add its fifth in addition to it.\v 32 As for every tenth of the herd or the flock, anything that passes under the rod, the tenth must be set apart to Yahweh.\v 33 He must not seek to distinguish between good and bad, and he must not exchange it. And if he exchanges it at all, then it will be and its substitute will be set apart. It must not be redeemed.’”
\p \v 34 These are the commandments that Yahweh commanded Moses for the sons of Israel at Mount Sinai.
