01001001	In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 
01001002	Now the earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters. 
01001003	And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 
01001004	And God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness. 
01001005	God called the light “day,” and the darkness He called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day. 
01001006	And God said, “Let there be an expanse between the waters, to separate the waters from the waters.” 
01001007	So God made the expanse and separated the waters beneath it from the waters above. And it was so. 
01001008	God called the expanse “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day. 
01001009	And God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered into one place, so that the dry land may appear.” And it was so. 
01001010	God called the dry land “earth,” and the gathering of waters He called “seas.” And God saw that it was good. 
01001011	Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth vegetation: seed-bearing plants and fruit trees, each bearing fruit with seed according to its kind.” And it was so. 
01001012	The earth produced vegetation: seed-bearing plants according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. 
01001013	And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day. 
01001014	And God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to distinguish between the day and the night, and let them be signs to mark the seasons and days and years. 
01001015	And let them serve as lights in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the earth.” And it was so. 
01001016	God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night. And He made the stars as well. 
01001017	God set these lights in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the earth, 
01001018	to preside over the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. 
01001019	And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day. 
01001020	And God said, “Let the waters teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the sky.” 
01001021	So God created the great sea creatures and every living thing that moves, with which the waters teemed according to their kinds, and every winged bird after its kind. And God saw that it was good. 
01001022	Then God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters of the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” 
01001023	And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day. 
01001024	And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, land crawlers, and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so. 
01001025	God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and everything that crawls upon the earth according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 
01001026	Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness, to rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, and over all the earth itself and every creature that crawls upon it.” 
01001027	So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. 
01001028	God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and every creature that crawls upon the earth.” 
01001029	Then God said, “Behold, I have given you every seed-bearing plant on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit contains seed. They will be yours for food. 
01001030	And to every beast of the earth and every bird of the air and every creature that crawls upon the earth—everything that has the breath of life in it—I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so. 
01001031	And God looked upon all that He had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day. 
01002001	Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array. 
01002002	And by the seventh day God had finished the work He had been doing; so on that day He rested from all His work. 
01002003	Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because on that day He rested from all the work of creation that He had accomplished. 
01002004	This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made them. 
01002005	Now no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth, nor had any plant of the field sprouted, for the LORD God had not yet sent rain upon the earth, and there was no man to cultivate the ground. 
01002006	But springs welled up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground. 
01002007	Then the LORD God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed the breath of life into his nostrils, and the man became a living being. 
01002008	And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, where He placed the man He had formed. 
01002009	Out of the ground the LORD God gave growth to every tree that is pleasing to the eye and good for food. And in the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. 
01002010	Now a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it branched into four headwaters: 
01002011	The name of the first river is the Pishon; it winds through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. 
01002012	And the gold of that land is pure, and bdellium and onyx are found there. 
01002013	The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the whole land of Cush. 
01002014	The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. 
01002015	Then the LORD God took the man and placed him in the Garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it. 
01002016	And the LORD God commanded him, “You may eat freely from every tree of the garden, 
01002017	but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.” 
01002018	The LORD God also said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make for him a suitable helper.” 
01002019	And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and He brought them to the man to see what he would name each one. And whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. 
01002020	The man gave names to all the livestock, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field. But for Adam no suitable helper was found. 
01002021	So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, and while he slept, He took one of the man’s ribs and closed up the area with flesh. 
01002022	And from the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man, He made a woman and brought her to him. 
01002023	And the man said: “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called ‘woman,’ for out of man she was taken.” 
01002024	For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh. 
01002025	And the man and his wife were both naked, and they were not ashamed. 
01003001	Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field that the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden?’” 
01003002	The woman answered the serpent, “We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden, 
01003003	but about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You must not eat of it or touch it, or you will die.’” 
01003004	“You will not surely die,” the serpent told the woman. 
01003005	“For God knows that in the day you eat of it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” 
01003006	When the woman saw that the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eyes, and that it was desirable for obtaining wisdom, she took the fruit and ate it. She also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate it. 
01003007	And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; so they sewed together fig leaves and made coverings for themselves. 
01003008	Then the man and his wife heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the breeze of the day, and they hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden. 
01003009	But the LORD God called out to the man, “Where are you?” 
01003010	“I heard Your voice in the garden,” he replied, “and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself.” 
01003011	“Who told you that you were naked?” asked the LORD God. “Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?” 
01003012	And the man answered, “The woman whom You gave me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.” 
01003013	Then the LORD God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” “The serpent deceived me,” she replied, “and I ate.” 
01003014	So the LORD God said to the serpent: “Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and every beast of the field! On your belly will you go, and dust you will eat, all the days of your life. 
01003015	And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed. He will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.” 
01003016	To the woman He said: “I will sharply increase your pain in childbirth; in pain you will bring forth children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.” 
01003017	And to Adam He said: “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat, cursed is the ground because of you; through toil you will eat of it all the days of your life. 
01003018	Both thorns and thistles it will yield for you, and you will eat the plants of the field. 
01003019	By the sweat of your brow you will eat your bread, until you return to the ground— because out of it were you taken. For dust you are, and to dust you shall return.” 
01003020	And Adam named his wife Eve, because she would be the mother of all the living. 
01003021	And the LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife, and He clothed them. 
01003022	Then the LORD God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil. And now, lest he reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever...” 
01003023	Therefore the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken. 
01003024	So He drove out the man and stationed cherubim on the east side of the Garden of Eden, along with a whirling sword of flame to guard the way to the tree of life. 
01004001	And Adam had relations with his wife Eve, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain. “With the help of the LORD I have brought forth a man,” she said. 
01004002	Later she gave birth to Cain’s brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, while Cain was a tiller of the soil. 
01004003	So in the course of time, Cain brought some of the fruit of the soil as an offering to the LORD, 
01004004	while Abel brought the best portions of the firstborn of his flock. And the LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering, 
01004005	but He had no regard for Cain and his offering. So Cain became very angry, and his countenance fell. 
01004006	“Why are you angry,” said the LORD to Cain, “and why has your countenance fallen? 
01004007	If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you refuse to do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires you, but you must master it.” 
01004008	Then Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let us go out to the field.” And while they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him. 
01004009	And the LORD said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” “I do not know!” he answered. “Am I my brother’s keeper?” 
01004010	“What have you done?” replied the LORD. “The voice of your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground. 
01004011	Now you are cursed and banished from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. 
01004012	When you till the ground, it will no longer yield its produce to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.” 
01004013	But Cain said to the LORD, “My punishment is greater than I can bear. 
01004014	Behold, this day You have driven me from the face of the earth, and from Your face I will be hidden; I will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.” 
01004015	“Not so!” replied the LORD. “If anyone slays Cain, then Cain will be avenged sevenfold.” And the LORD placed a mark on Cain, so that no one who found him would kill him. 
01004016	So Cain went out from the presence of the LORD and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden. 
01004017	And Cain had relations with his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch. Then Cain built a city and named it after his son Enoch. 
01004018	Now to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methusael, and Methusael was the father of Lamech. 
01004019	And Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah. 
01004020	Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and raise livestock. 
01004021	And his brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play the harp and flute. 
01004022	And Zillah gave birth to Tubal-cain, a forger of every implement of bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah. 
01004023	Then Lamech said to his wives: “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; wives of Lamech, listen to my speech. For I have slain a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me. 
01004024	If Cain is avenged sevenfold, then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.” 
01004025	And Adam again had relations with his wife, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, “God has granted me another seed in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.” 
01004026	And to Seth also a son was born, and he called him Enosh. At that time men began to call upon the name of the LORD. 
01005001	This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, He made him in His own likeness. 
01005002	Male and female He created them, and He blessed them. And in the day they were created, He called them “man.” 
01005003	When Adam was 130 years old, he had a son in his own likeness, after his own image; and he named him Seth. 
01005004	And after he had become the father of Seth, Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters. 
01005005	So Adam lived a total of 930 years, and then he died. 
01005006	When Seth was 105 years old, he became the father of Enosh. 
01005007	And after he had become the father of Enosh, Seth lived 807 years and had other sons and daughters. 
01005008	So Seth lived a total of 912 years, and then he died. 
01005009	When Enosh was 90 years old, he became the father of Kenan. 
01005010	And after he had become the father of Kenan, Enosh lived 815 years and had other sons and daughters. 
01005011	So Enosh lived a total of 905 years, and then he died. 
01005012	When Kenan was 70 years old, he became the father of Mahalalel. 
01005013	And after he had become the father of Mahalalel, Kenan lived 840 years and had other sons and daughters. 
01005014	So Kenan lived a total of 910 years, and then he died. 
01005015	When Mahalalel was 65 years old, he became the father of Jared. 
01005016	And after he had become the father of Jared, Mahalalel lived 830 years and had other sons and daughters. 
01005017	So Mahalalel lived a total of 895 years, and then he died. 
01005018	When Jared was 162 years old, he became the father of Enoch. 
01005019	And after he had become the father of Enoch, Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters. 
01005020	So Jared lived a total of 962 years, and then he died. 
01005021	When Enoch was 65 years old, he became the father of Methuselah. 
01005022	And after he had become the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters. 
01005023	So Enoch lived a total of 365 years. 
01005024	Enoch walked with God, and then he was no more, because God had taken him away. 
01005025	When Methuselah was 187 years old, he became the father of Lamech. 
01005026	And after he had become the father of Lamech, Methuselah lived 782 years and had other sons and daughters. 
01005027	So Methuselah lived a total of 969 years, and then he died. 
01005028	When Lamech was 182 years old, he had a son. 
01005029	And he named him Noah, saying, “May this one comfort us in the labor and toil of our hands caused by the ground that the LORD has cursed.” 
01005030	And after he had become the father of Noah, Lamech lived 595 years and had other sons and daughters. 
01005031	So Lamech lived a total of 777 years, and then he died. 
01005032	After Noah was 500 years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 
01006001	Now when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born to them, 
01006002	the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they took as wives whomever they chose. 
01006003	So the LORD said, “My Spirit will not contend with man forever, for he is mortal; his days shall be 120 years.” 
01006004	The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and afterward as well—when the sons of God had relations with the daughters of men. And they bore them children who became the mighty men of old, men of renown. 
01006005	Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great upon the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was altogether evil all the time. 
01006006	And the LORD regretted that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. 
01006007	So the LORD said, “I will blot out man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth—every man and beast and crawling creature and bird of the air—for I am grieved that I have made them.” 
01006008	Noah, however, found favor in the eyes of the LORD. 
01006009	This is the account of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation; Noah walked with God. 
01006010	And Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 
01006011	Now the earth was corrupt in the sight of God, and full of violence. 
01006012	And God looked upon the earth and saw that it was corrupt; for all living creatures on the earth had corrupted their ways. 
01006013	Then God said to Noah, “The end of all living creatures has come before Me, because through them the earth is full of violence. Now behold, I will destroy both them and the earth. 
01006014	Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood; make rooms in the ark and coat it with pitch inside and out. 
01006015	And this is how you are to build it: The ark is to be 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high. 
01006016	You are to make a roof for the ark, finish its walls a cubit from the top, place a door in the side of the ark, and build lower, middle, and upper decks. 
01006017	And behold, I will bring floodwaters upon the earth to destroy every creature under the heavens that has the breath of life. Everything on the earth will perish. 
01006018	But I will establish My covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you. 
01006019	And you are to bring two of every living creature into the ark—male and female—to keep them alive with you. 
01006020	Two of every kind of bird and animal and crawling creature will come to you to be kept alive. 
01006021	You are also to take for yourself every kind of food that is eaten and gather it as food for yourselves and for the animals.” 
01006022	So Noah did everything precisely as God had commanded him. 
01007001	Then the LORD said to Noah, “Go into the ark, you and all your family, because I have found you righteous in this generation. 
01007002	You are to take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate; a pair of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate; 
01007003	and seven pairs of every kind of bird of the air, male and female, to preserve their offspring on the face of all the earth. 
01007004	For seven days from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe from the face of the earth every living thing I have made.” 
01007005	And Noah did all that the LORD had commanded him. 
01007006	Now Noah was 600 years old when the floodwaters came upon the earth. 
01007007	And Noah and his wife, with his sons and their wives, entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood. 
01007008	The clean and unclean animals, the birds, and everything that crawls along the ground 
01007009	came to Noah to enter the ark, two by two, male and female, as God had commanded Noah. 
01007010	And after seven days the floodwaters came upon the earth. 
01007011	In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, on the seventeenth day of the second month, all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened. 
01007012	And the rain fell upon the earth for forty days and forty nights. 
01007013	On that very day Noah entered the ark, along with his sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and his wife, and the three wives of his sons— 
01007014	they and every kind of wild animal, livestock, crawling creature, bird, and winged creature. 
01007015	They came to Noah to enter the ark, two by two of every creature with the breath of life. 
01007016	And they entered, the male and female of every living thing, as God had commanded Noah. Then the LORD shut him in. 
01007017	For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and the waters rose and lifted the ark high above the earth. 
01007018	So the waters continued to surge and rise greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the waters. 
01007019	Finally, the waters completely prevailed upon the earth, so that all the high mountains under all the heavens were covered. 
01007020	The waters rose and covered the mountaintops to a depth of fifteen cubits. 
01007021	And every living thing that moved upon the earth perished—birds, livestock, animals, every creature that swarms upon the earth, and all mankind. 
01007022	Of all that was on dry land, everything that had the breath of life in its nostrils died. 
01007023	And every living thing on the face of the earth was destroyed—man and livestock, crawling creatures and birds of the air; they were blotted out from the earth, and only Noah and those with him in the ark remained. 
01007024	And the waters prevailed upon the earth for 150 days. 
01008001	But God remembered Noah and all the animals and livestock that were with him in the ark. And God sent a wind over the earth, and the waters began to subside. 
01008002	The springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens were closed, and the rain from the sky was restrained. 
01008003	The waters receded steadily from the earth, and after 150 days the waters had gone down. 
01008004	On the seventeenth day of the seventh month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. 
01008005	And the waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible. 
01008006	After forty days Noah opened the window he had made in the ark 
01008007	and sent out a raven. It kept flying back and forth until the waters had dried up from the earth. 
01008008	Then Noah sent out a dove to see if the waters had receded from the surface of the ground. 
01008009	But the dove found no place to rest her foot, and she returned to him in the ark, because the waters were still covering the surface of all the earth. So he reached out his hand and brought her back inside the ark. 
01008010	Noah waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark. 
01008011	And behold, the dove returned to him in the evening with a freshly plucked olive leaf in her beak. So Noah knew that the waters had receded from the earth. 
01008012	And Noah waited seven more days and sent out the dove again, but this time she did not return to him. 
01008013	In Noah’s six hundred and first year, on the first day of the first month, the waters had dried up from the earth. So Noah removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry. 
01008014	By the twenty-seventh day of the second month, the earth was fully dry. 
01008015	Then God said to Noah, 
01008016	“Come out of the ark, you and your wife, along with your sons and their wives. 
01008017	Bring out all the living creatures that are with you—birds, livestock, and everything that crawls upon the ground—so that they can spread out over the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon it.” 
01008018	So Noah came out, along with his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives. 
01008019	Every living creature, every creeping thing, and every bird—everything that moves upon the earth—came out of the ark, kind by kind. 
01008020	Then Noah built an altar to the LORD. And taking from every kind of clean animal and clean bird, he offered burnt offerings on the altar. 
01008021	When the LORD smelled the pleasing aroma, He said in His heart, “Never again will I curse the ground because of man, even though every inclination of his heart is evil from his youth. And never again will I destroy all living creatures as I have done. 
01008022	As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night shall never cease.” 
01009001	And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth. 
01009002	The fear and dread of you will fall on every living creature on the earth, every bird of the air, every creature that crawls on the ground, and all the fish of the sea. They are delivered into your hand. 
01009003	Everything that lives and moves will be food for you; just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you all things. 
01009004	But you must not eat meat with its lifeblood still in it. 
01009005	And surely I will require the life of any man or beast by whose hand your lifeblood is shed. I will demand an accounting from anyone who takes the life of his fellow man: 
01009006	Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man his blood will be shed; for in His own image God has made mankind. 
01009007	But as for you, be fruitful and multiply; spread out across the earth and multiply upon it.” 
01009008	Then God said to Noah and his sons with him, 
01009009	“Behold, I now establish My covenant with you and your descendants after you, 
01009010	and with every living creature that was with you—the birds, the livestock, and every beast of the earth—every living thing that came out of the ark. 
01009011	And I establish My covenant with you: Never again will all life be cut off by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.” 
01009012	And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant I am making between Me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come: 
01009013	I have set My rainbow in the clouds, and it will be a sign of the covenant between Me and the earth. 
01009014	Whenever I form clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds, 
01009015	I will remember My covenant between Me and you and every living creature of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life. 
01009016	And whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of every kind that is on the earth.” 
01009017	So God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between Me and every creature on the earth.” 
01009018	The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And Ham was the father of Canaan. 
01009019	These three were the sons of Noah, and from them the whole earth was populated. 
01009020	Now Noah, a man of the soil, proceeded to plant a vineyard. 
01009021	But when he drank some of its wine, he became drunk and uncovered himself inside his tent. 
01009022	And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father’s nakedness and told his two brothers outside. 
01009023	Then Shem and Japheth took a garment and placed it across their shoulders, and walking backward, they covered their father’s nakedness. Their faces were turned away so that they did not see their father’s nakedness. 
01009024	When Noah awoke from his drunkenness and learned what his youngest son had done to him, 
01009025	he said, “Cursed be Canaan! A servant of servants shall he be to his brothers.” 
01009026	He also declared: “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem! May Canaan be the servant of Shem. 
01009027	May God expand the territory of Japheth; may he dwell in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be his servant.” 
01009028	After the flood, Noah lived 350 years. 
01009029	So Noah lived a total of 950 years, and then he died. 
01010001	This is the account of Noah’s sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, who also had sons after the flood. 
01010002	The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. 
01010003	The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. 
01010004	And the sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, the Kittites, and the Rodanites. 
01010005	From these, the maritime peoples separated into their territories, according to their languages, by clans within their nations. 
01010006	The sons of Ham: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan. 
01010007	The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. And the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan. 
01010008	Cush was the father of Nimrod, who began to be a mighty one on the earth. 
01010009	He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; so it is said, “Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the LORD.” 
01010010	His kingdom began in Babylon, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 
01010011	From that land he went forth into Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah, 
01010012	and Resen, which is between Nineveh and the great city of Calah. 
01010013	Mizraim was the father of the Ludites, the Anamites, the Lehabites, the Naphtuhites, 
01010014	the Pathrusites, the Casluhites (from whom the Philistines came), and the Caphtorites. 
01010015	And Canaan was the father of Sidon his firstborn, and of the Hittites, 
01010016	the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, 
01010017	the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, 
01010018	the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Later the Canaanite clans were scattered, 
01010019	and the borders of Canaan extended from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. 
01010020	These are the sons of Ham according to their clans, languages, lands, and nations. 
01010021	And sons were also born to Shem, the older brother of Japheth; Shem was the forefather of all the sons of Eber. 
01010022	The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram. 
01010023	The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. 
01010024	Arphaxad was the father of Shelah, and Shelah was the father of Eber. 
01010025	Two sons were born to Eber: One was named Peleg, because in his days the earth was divided, and his brother was named Joktan. 
01010026	And Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 
01010027	Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 
01010028	Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 
01010029	Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were sons of Joktan. 
01010030	Their territory extended from Mesha to Sephar, in the eastern hill country. 
01010031	These are the sons of Shem, according to their clans, languages, lands, and nations. 
01010032	All these are the clans of Noah’s sons, according to their generations and nations. From these the nations of the earth spread out after the flood. 
01011001	Now the whole world had one language and a common form of speech. 
01011002	And as people journeyed eastward, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. 
01011003	And they said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” So they used brick instead of stone, and tar instead of mortar. 
01011004	“Come,” they said, “let us build for ourselves a city with a tower that reaches to the heavens, that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of all the earth.” 
01011005	Then the LORD came down to see the city and the tower that the sons of men were building. 
01011006	And the LORD said, “If they have begun to do this as one people speaking the same language, then nothing they devise will be beyond them. 
01011007	Come, let Us go down and confuse their language, so that they will not understand one another’s speech.” 
01011008	So the LORD scattered them from there over the face of all the earth, and they stopped building the city. 
01011009	That is why it is called Babel, for there the LORD confused the language of the whole world, and from that place the LORD scattered them over the face of all the earth. 
01011010	This is the account of Shem. Two years after the flood, when Shem was 100 years old, he became the father of Arphaxad. 
01011011	And after he had become the father of Arphaxad, Shem lived 500 years and had other sons and daughters. 
01011012	When Arphaxad was 35 years old, he became the father of Shelah. 
01011013	And after he had become the father of Shelah, Arphaxad lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters. 
01011014	When Shelah was 30 years old, he became the father of Eber. 
01011015	And after he had become the father of Eber, Shelah lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters. 
01011016	When Eber was 34 years old, he became the father of Peleg. 
01011017	And after he had become the father of Peleg, Eber lived 430 years and had other sons and daughters. 
01011018	When Peleg was 30 years old, he became the father of Reu. 
01011019	And after he had become the father of Reu, Peleg lived 209 years and had other sons and daughters. 
01011020	When Reu was 32 years old, he became the father of Serug. 
01011021	And after he had become the father of Serug, Reu lived 207 years and had other sons and daughters. 
01011022	When Serug was 30 years old, he became the father of Nahor. 
01011023	And after he had become the father of Nahor, Serug lived 200 years and had other sons and daughters. 
01011024	When Nahor was 29 years old, he became the father of Terah. 
01011025	And after he had become the father of Terah, Nahor lived 119 years and had other sons and daughters. 
01011026	When Terah was 70 years old, he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. 
01011027	This is the account of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran became the father of Lot. 
01011028	During his father Terah’s lifetime, Haran died in his native land, in Ur of the Chaldeans. 
01011029	And Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves. Abram’s wife was named Sarai, and Nahor’s wife was named Milcah; she was the daughter of Haran, who was the father of both Milcah and Iscah. 
01011030	But Sarai was barren; she had no children. 
01011031	And Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai the wife of Abram, and they set out from Ur of the Chaldeans for the land of Canaan. But when they arrived in Haran, they settled there. 
01011032	Terah lived 205 years, and he died in Haran. 
01012001	Then the LORD said to Abram, “Leave your country, your kindred, and your father’s household, and go to the land I will show you. 
01012002	I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. 
01012003	I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you; and all the families of the earth will be blessed through you.” 
01012004	So Abram departed, as the LORD had directed him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he left Haran. 
01012005	And Abram took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, and all the possessions and people they had acquired in Haran, and set out for the land of Canaan. When they came to the land of Canaan, 
01012006	Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of the Oak of Moreh at Shechem. And at that time the Canaanites were in the land. 
01012007	Then the LORD appeared to Abram and said, “I will give this land to your offspring.” So Abram built an altar there to the LORD, who had appeared to him. 
01012008	From there Abram moved on to the hill country east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel to the west and Ai to the east. There he built an altar to the LORD, and he called on the name of the LORD. 
01012009	And Abram journeyed on toward the Negev. 
01012010	Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while because the famine was severe. 
01012011	As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, “Look, I know that you are a beautiful woman, 
01012012	and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they will kill me but will let you live. 
01012013	Please say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake, and on account of you my life will be spared.” 
01012014	So when Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful. 
01012015	When Pharaoh’s officials saw Sarai, they commended her to him, and she was taken into the palace of Pharaoh. 
01012016	He treated Abram well on her account, and Abram acquired sheep and cattle, male and female donkeys, menservants and maidservants, and camels. 
01012017	The LORD, however, afflicted Pharaoh and his household with severe plagues because of Abram’s wife Sarai. 
01012018	So Pharaoh summoned Abram and asked, “What have you done to me? Why didn’t you tell me she was your wife? 
01012019	Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her as my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go!” 
01012020	Then Pharaoh gave his men orders concerning Abram, and they sent him away with his wife and all his possessions. 
01013001	So Abram went up out of Egypt into the Negev—he and his wife and all his possessions—and Lot was with him. 
01013002	And Abram had become extremely wealthy in livestock and silver and gold. 
01013003	From the Negev he journeyed from place to place toward Bethel, until he came to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had formerly been pitched, 
01013004	to the site where he had built the altar. And there Abram called on the name of the LORD. 
01013005	Now Lot, who was traveling with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents. 
01013006	But the land was unable to support both of them while they stayed together, for they had so many possessions that they were unable to coexist. 
01013007	And there was discord between the herdsmen of Abram and the herdsmen of Lot. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were also living in the land. 
01013008	So Abram said to Lot, “Please let there be no contention between you and me, or between your herdsmen and my herdsmen. After all, we are kinsmen. 
01013009	Is not the whole land before you? Now separate yourself from me. If you go to the left, I will go to the right; if you go to the right, I will go to the left.” 
01013010	And Lot looked out and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan, all the way to Zoar, was well watered like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt. (This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.) 
01013011	So Lot chose the whole plain of the Jordan for himself and set out toward the east. And Abram and Lot parted company. 
01013012	Abram lived in the land of Canaan, but Lot settled in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward Sodom. 
01013013	But the men of Sodom were wicked, sinning greatly against the LORD. 
01013014	After Lot had departed, the LORD said to Abram, “Now lift up your eyes from the place where you are, and look to the north and south and east and west, 
01013015	for all the land that you see, I will give to you and your offspring forever. 
01013016	I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if one could count the dust of the earth, then your offspring could be counted. 
01013017	Get up and walk around the land, through its length and breadth, for I will give it to you.” 
01013018	So Abram moved his tent and went to live near the Oaks of Mamre at Hebron, where he built an altar to the LORD. 
01014001	In those days Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim 
01014002	went to war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar). 
01014003	The latter five came as allies to the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea ). 
01014004	For twelve years they had been subject to Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled. 
01014005	In the fourteenth year, Chedorlaomer and the kings allied with him went out and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in Shaveh-kiriathaim, 
01014006	and the Horites in the area of Mount Seir, as far as El-paran, which is near the desert. 
01014007	Then they turned back to invade En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who lived in Hazazon-tamar. 
01014008	Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) marched out and arrayed themselves for battle in the Valley of Siddim 
01014009	against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against five. 
01014010	Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some men fell into the pits, but the survivors fled to the hill country. 
01014011	The four kings seized all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food, and they went on their way. 
01014012	They also carried off Abram’s nephew Lot and his possessions, since Lot was living in Sodom. 
01014013	Then an escapee came and reported this to Abram the Hebrew. Now Abram was living near the Oaks of Mamre the Amorite, a brother of Eshcol and Aner, all of whom were bound by treaty to Abram. 
01014014	And when Abram heard that his relative had been captured, he mobilized the 318 trained men born in his household, and they set out in pursuit as far as Dan. 
01014015	During the night, Abram divided his forces and routed Chedorlaomer’s army, pursuing them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus. 
01014016	He retrieved all the goods, as well as his relative Lot and his possessions, together with the women and the rest of the people. 
01014017	After Abram returned from defeating Chedorlaomer and the kings allied with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley). 
01014018	Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine—since he was priest of God Most High — 
01014019	and he blessed Abram and said: “Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth, 
01014020	and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand.” Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of everything. 
01014021	The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people, but take the goods for yourself.” 
01014022	But Abram replied to the king of Sodom, “I have raised my hand to the LORD God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth, 
01014023	that I will not accept even a thread, or a strap of a sandal, or anything that belongs to you, lest you should say, ‘I have made Abram rich.’ 
01014024	I will accept nothing but what my men have eaten and the share for the men who went with me—Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. They may take their portion.” 
01015001	After these events, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: “Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your very great reward.” 
01015002	But Abram replied, “O Lord GOD, what can You give me, since I remain childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?” 
01015003	Abram continued, “Behold, You have given me no offspring, so a servant in my household will be my heir.” 
01015004	Then the word of the LORD came to Abram, saying, “This one will not be your heir, but one who comes from your own body will be your heir.” 
01015005	And the LORD took him outside and said, “Now look to the heavens and count the stars, if you are able.” Then He told him, “So shall your offspring be.” 
01015006	Abram believed the LORD, and it was credited to him as righteousness. 
01015007	The LORD also told him, “I am the LORD, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.” 
01015008	But Abram replied, “Lord GOD, how can I know that I will possess it?” 
01015009	And the LORD said to him, “Bring Me a heifer, a goat, and a ram, each three years old, along with a turtledove and a young pigeon.” 
01015010	So Abram brought all these to Him, split each of them down the middle, and laid the halves opposite each other. The birds, however, he did not cut in half. 
01015011	And the birds of prey descended on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away. 
01015012	As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and suddenly great terror and darkness overwhelmed him. 
01015013	Then the LORD said to Abram, “Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years. 
01015014	But I will judge the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will depart with many possessions. 
01015015	You, however, will go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a ripe old age. 
01015016	In the fourth generation your descendants will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.” 
01015017	When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, behold, a smoking firepot and a flaming torch appeared and passed between the halves of the carcasses. 
01015018	On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your descendants I have given this land—from the river of Egypt to the great River Euphrates— 
01015019	the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, 
01015020	Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, 
01015021	Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites.” 
01016001	Now Abram’s wife Sarai had borne him no children, but she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar. 
01016002	So Sarai said to Abram, “Look now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Please go to my maidservant; perhaps I can build a family by her.” And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai. 
01016003	So after he had lived in Canaan for ten years, his wife Sarai took her Egyptian maidservant Hagar and gave her to Abram to be his wife. 
01016004	And he slept with Hagar, and she conceived. But when Hagar realized that she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress. 
01016005	Then Sarai said to Abram, “May the wrong done to me be upon you! I delivered my servant into your arms, and ever since she saw that she was pregnant, she has treated me with contempt. May the LORD judge between you and me.” 
01016006	“Here,” said Abram, “your servant is in your hands. Do whatever you want with her.” Then Sarai treated Hagar so harshly that she fled from her. 
01016007	Now the angel of the LORD found Hagar by a spring of water in the desert—the spring along the road to Shur. 
01016008	“Hagar, servant of Sarai,” he said, “where have you come from, and where are you going?” “I am running away from my mistress Sarai,” she replied. 
01016009	So the angel of the LORD told her, “Return to your mistress and submit to her authority.” 
01016010	Then the angel added, “I will greatly multiply your offspring so that they will be too numerous to count.” 
01016011	The angel of the LORD proceeded: “Behold, you have conceived and will bear a son. And you shall name him Ishmael, for the LORD has heard your cry of affliction. 
01016012	He will be a wild donkey of a man, and his hand will be against everyone, and everyone’s hand against him; he will live in hostility toward all his brothers.” 
01016013	So Hagar gave this name to the LORD who had spoken to her: “You are the God who sees me,” for she said, “Here I have seen the One who sees me!” 
01016014	Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi. It is located between Kadesh and Bered. 
01016015	And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne. 
01016016	Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him. 
01017001	When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, “I am God Almighty. Walk before Me and be blameless. 
01017002	I will establish My covenant between Me and you, and I will multiply you exceedingly.” 
01017003	Then Abram fell facedown, and God said to him, 
01017004	“As for Me, this is My covenant with you: You will be the father of many nations. 
01017005	No longer will you be called Abram, but your name will be Abraham, for I have made you a father of many nations. 
01017006	I will make you exceedingly fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will descend from you. 
01017007	I will establish My covenant as an everlasting covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you. 
01017008	And to you and your descendants I will give the land where you are residing—all the land of Canaan—as an eternal possession; and I will be their God.” 
01017009	God also said to Abraham, “You must keep My covenant—you and your descendants in the generations after you. 
01017010	This is My covenant with you and your descendants after you, which you are to keep: Every male among you must be circumcised. 
01017011	You are to circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and this will be a sign of the covenant between Me and you. 
01017012	Generation after generation, every male must be circumcised when he is eight days old, including those born in your household and those purchased from a foreigner—even those who are not your offspring. 
01017013	Whether they are born in your household or purchased, they must be circumcised. My covenant in your flesh will be an everlasting covenant. 
01017014	But if any male is not circumcised, he will be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.” 
01017015	Then God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, do not call her Sarai, for her name is to be Sarah. 
01017016	And I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will descend from her.” 
01017017	Abraham fell facedown. Then he laughed and said to himself, “Can a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Can Sarah give birth at the age of ninety?” 
01017018	And Abraham said to God, “O that Ishmael might live under Your blessing!” 
01017019	But God replied, “Your wife Sarah will indeed bear you a son, and you are to name him Isaac. I will establish My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him. 
01017020	As for Ishmael, I have heard you, and I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and multiply him greatly. He will become the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation. 
01017021	But I will establish My covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this time next year.” 
01017022	When He had finished speaking with Abraham, God went up from him. 
01017023	On that very day Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his household or purchased with his money—every male among the members of Abraham’s household—and he circumcised them, just as God had told him. 
01017024	So Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised, 
01017025	and his son Ishmael was thirteen; 
01017026	Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised on the same day. 
01017027	And all the men of Abraham’s household—both servants born in his household and those purchased from foreigners—were circumcised with him. 
01018001	Then the LORD appeared to Abraham by the Oaks of Mamre in the heat of the day, while he was sitting at the entrance of his tent. 
01018002	And Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he ran from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground. 
01018003	“My lord,” said Abraham, “if I have found favor in your sight, please do not pass your servant by. 
01018004	Let a little water be brought, that you may wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree. 
01018005	And I will bring a bit of bread so that you may refresh yourselves. This is why you have passed your servant’s way. After that, you may continue on your way.” “Yes,” they replied, “you may do as you have said.” 
01018006	So Abraham hurried into the tent and said to Sarah, “Quick! Prepare three seahs of fine flour, knead it, and bake some bread.” 
01018007	Meanwhile, Abraham ran to the herd, selected a tender and choice calf, and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it. 
01018008	Then Abraham brought curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared, and he set them before the men and stood by them under the tree as they ate. 
01018009	“Where is your wife Sarah?” they asked. “There, in the tent,” he replied. 
01018010	Then the LORD said, “I will surely return to you at this time next year, and your wife Sarah will have a son!” Now Sarah was behind him, listening at the entrance to the tent. 
01018011	And Abraham and Sarah were already old and well along in years; Sarah had passed the age of childbearing. 
01018012	So she laughed to herself, saying, “After I am worn out and my master is old, will I now have this pleasure?” 
01018013	And the LORD asked Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Can I really bear a child when I am old?’ 
01018014	Is anything too difficult for the LORD? At the appointed time I will return to you—in about a year—and Sarah will have a son.” 
01018015	But Sarah was afraid, so she denied it and said, “I did not laugh.” “No,” replied the LORD, “but you did laugh.” 
01018016	When the men got up to leave, they looked out over Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them off. 
01018017	And the LORD said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do? 
01018018	Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and through him all the nations of the earth will be blessed. 
01018019	For I have chosen him, so that he will command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing what is right and just, in order that the LORD may bring upon Abraham what He has promised.” 
01018020	Then the LORD said, “The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great. Because their sin is so grievous, 
01018021	I will go down to see if their actions fully justify the outcry that has reached Me. If not, I will find out.” 
01018022	And the two men turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the LORD. 
01018023	Abraham stepped forward and said, “Will You really sweep away the righteous with the wicked? 
01018024	What if there are fifty righteous ones in the city? Will You really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous ones who are there? 
01018025	Far be it from You to do such a thing—to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked are treated alike. Far be it from You! Will not the Judge of all the earth do what is right?” 
01018026	So the LORD replied, “If I find fifty righteous ones within the city of Sodom, on their account I will spare the whole place.” 
01018027	Then Abraham answered, “Now that I have ventured to speak to the Lord—though I am but dust and ashes— 
01018028	suppose the fifty righteous ones lack five. Will You destroy the whole city for the lack of five?” He replied, “If I find forty-five there, I will not destroy it.” 
01018029	Once again Abraham spoke to the LORD, “Suppose forty are found there?” He answered, “On account of the forty, I will not do it.” 
01018030	Then Abraham said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak further. Suppose thirty are found there?” He replied, “If I find thirty there, I will not do it.” 
01018031	And Abraham said, “Now that I have ventured to speak to the Lord, suppose twenty are found there?” He answered, “On account of the twenty, I will not destroy it.” 
01018032	Finally, Abraham said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak once more. Suppose ten are found there?” And He answered, “On account of the ten, I will not destroy it.” 
01018033	When the LORD had finished speaking with Abraham, He departed, and Abraham returned home. 
01019001	Now the two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When Lot saw them, he got up to meet them, bowed facedown, 
01019002	and said, “My lords, please turn aside into the house of your servant; wash your feet and spend the night. Then you can rise early and go on your way.” “No,” they answered, “we will spend the night in the square.” 
01019003	But Lot insisted so strongly that they followed him into his house. He prepared a feast for them and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. 
01019004	Before they had gone to bed, all the men of the city of Sodom, both young and old, surrounded the house. 
01019005	They called out to Lot, saying, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Send them out to us so we can have relations with them!” 
01019006	Lot went outside to meet them, shutting the door behind him. 
01019007	“Please, my brothers,” he pleaded, “don’t do such a wicked thing! 
01019008	Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them to you, and you can do to them as you please. But do not do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.” 
01019009	“Get out of the way!” they replied. And they declared, “This one came here as a foreigner, and he is already acting like a judge! Now we will treat you worse than them.” And they pressed in on Lot and moved in to break down the door. 
01019010	But the men inside reached out, pulled Lot into the house with them, and shut the door. 
01019011	And they struck the men at the entrance, young and old, with blindness, so that they wearied themselves trying to find the door. 
01019012	Then the two men said to Lot, “Do you have anyone else here—a son-in-law, your sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here, 
01019013	because we are about to destroy this place. For the outcry to the LORD against its people is so great that He has sent us to destroy it.” 
01019014	So Lot went out and spoke to the sons-in-law who were pledged in marriage to his daughters. “Get up,” he said. “Get out of this place, for the LORD is about to destroy the city!” But his sons-in-law thought he was joking. 
01019015	At daybreak the angels hurried Lot along, saying, “Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city.” 
01019016	But when Lot hesitated, the men grabbed his hand and the hands of his wife and his two daughters. And they led them safely out of the city, because of the LORD’s compassion for them. 
01019017	As soon as the men had brought them out, one of them said, “Run for your lives! Do not look back, and do not stop anywhere on the plain! Flee to the mountains, or you will be swept away!” 
01019018	But Lot replied, “No, my lords, please! 
01019019	Your servant has indeed found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness by sparing my life. But I cannot run to the mountains; the disaster will overtake me, and I will die. 
01019020	Look, there is a town nearby where I can flee, and it is a small place. Please let me flee there—is it not a small place? Then my life will be saved.” 
01019021	“Very well,” he answered, “I will grant this request as well, and will not demolish the town you indicate. 
01019022	Hurry! Run there quickly, for I cannot do anything until you reach it.” That is why the town was called Zoar. 
01019023	And by the time the sun had risen over the land, Lot had reached Zoar. 
01019024	Then the LORD rained down sulfur and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah—from the LORD out of the heavens. 
01019025	Thus He destroyed these cities and the entire plain, including all the inhabitants of the cities and everything that grew on the ground. 
01019026	But Lot’s wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt. 
01019027	Early the next morning, Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the LORD. 
01019028	He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the land of the plain, and he saw the smoke rising from the land like smoke from a furnace. 
01019029	So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, He remembered Abraham, and He brought Lot out of the catastrophe that destroyed the cities where he had lived. 
01019030	Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains—for he was afraid to stay in Zoar—where they lived in a cave. 
01019031	One day the older daughter said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is no man in the land to sleep with us, as is the custom over all the earth. 
01019032	Come, let us get our father drunk with wine so we can sleep with him and preserve his line.” 
01019033	So that night they got their father drunk with wine, and the firstborn went in and slept with her father; he was not aware when she lay down or when she got up. 
01019034	The next day the older daughter said to the younger, “Look, I slept with my father last night. Let us get him drunk with wine again tonight so you can go in and sleep with him and we can preserve our father’s line.” 
01019035	So again that night they got their father drunk with wine, and the younger daughter went in and slept with him; he was not aware when she lay down or when she got up. 
01019036	Thus both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father. 
01019037	The older daughter gave birth to a son and named him Moab. He is the father of the Moabites of today. 
01019038	The younger daughter also gave birth to a son, and she named him Ben-ammi. He is the father of the Ammonites of today. 
01020001	Now Abraham journeyed from there to the region of the Negev and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he was staying in Gerar, 
01020002	Abraham said of his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.” So Abimelech king of Gerar had Sarah brought to him. 
01020003	One night, however, God came to Abimelech in a dream and told him, “You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken, for she is a married woman.” 
01020004	Now Abimelech had not gone near her, so he replied, “Lord, would You destroy a nation even though it is innocent? 
01020005	Didn’t Abraham tell me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ I have done this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands.” 
01020006	Then God said to Abimelech in the dream, “Yes, I know that you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against Me. That is why I did not let you touch her. 
01020007	Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet; he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not restore her, be aware that you will surely die—you and all who belong to you.” 
01020008	Early the next morning Abimelech got up and summoned all his servants; and when he described to them all that had happened, the men were terrified. 
01020009	Then Abimelech called Abraham and asked, “What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought such tremendous guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should not be done.” 
01020010	Abimelech also asked Abraham, “What prompted you to do such a thing?” 
01020011	Abraham replied, “I thought to myself, ‘Surely there is no fear of God in this place. They will kill me on account of my wife.’ 
01020012	Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father—though not the daughter of my mother—and she became my wife. 
01020013	So when God had me journey from my father’s house, I said to Sarah, ‘This is how you can show your loyalty to me: Wherever we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’” 
01020014	So Abimelech brought sheep and cattle, menservants and maidservants, and he gave them to Abraham and restored his wife Sarah to him. 
01020015	And Abimelech said, “Look, my land is before you. Settle wherever you please.” 
01020016	And he said to Sarah, “See, I am giving your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is your vindication before all who are with you; you are completely cleared.” 
01020017	Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maidservants, so that they could again bear children— 
01020018	for on account of Abraham’s wife Sarah, the LORD had completely closed all the wombs in Abimelech’s household. 
01021001	Now the LORD attended to Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did for Sarah what He had promised. 
01021002	So Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised. 
01021003	And Abraham gave the name Isaac to the son Sarah bore to him. 
01021004	When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God had commanded him. 
01021005	Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. 
01021006	Then Sarah said, “God has made me laugh, and everyone who hears of this will laugh with me.” 
01021007	She added, “Who would have told Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.” 
01021008	So the child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned. 
01021009	But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking her son, 
01021010	and she said to Abraham, “Expel the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac!” 
01021011	Now this matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son Ishmael. 
01021012	But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed about the boy and your maidservant. Listen to everything that Sarah tells you, for through Isaac your offspring will be reckoned. 
01021013	But I will also make a nation of the slave woman’s son, because he is your offspring.” 
01021014	Early in the morning, Abraham got up, took bread and a skin of water, put them on Hagar’s shoulders, and sent her away with the boy. She left and wandered in the Wilderness of Beersheba. 
01021015	When the water in the skin was gone, she left the boy under one of the bushes. 
01021016	Then she went off and sat down nearby, about a bowshot away, for she said, “I cannot bear to watch the boy die!” And as she sat nearby, she lifted up her voice and wept. 
01021017	Then God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, “What is wrong, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he lies. 
01021018	Get up, lift up the boy, and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation.” 
01021019	Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink. 
01021020	And God was with the boy, and he grew up and settled in the wilderness and became a great archer. 
01021021	And while he was dwelling in the Wilderness of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from the land of Egypt. 
01021022	At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham, “God is with you in all that you do. 
01021023	Now, therefore, swear to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or descendants. Show to me and to the country in which you reside the same kindness that I have shown to you.” 
01021024	And Abraham replied, “I swear it.” 
01021025	But when Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well that Abimelech’s servants had seized, 
01021026	Abimelech replied, “I do not know who has done this. You did not tell me, so I have not heard about it until today.” 
01021027	So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant. 
01021028	Abraham separated seven ewe lambs from the flock, 
01021029	and Abimelech asked him, “Why have you set apart these seven ewe lambs?” 
01021030	He replied, “You are to accept the seven ewe lambs from my hand as my witness that I dug this well.” 
01021031	So that place was called Beersheba, because it was there that the two of them swore an oath. 
01021032	After they had made the covenant at Beersheba, Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army got up and returned to the land of the Philistines. 
01021033	And Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called upon the name of the LORD, the Eternal God. 
01021034	And Abraham resided in the land of the Philistines for a long time. 
01022001	Some time later God tested Abraham and said to him, “Abraham!” “Here I am,” he answered. 
01022002	“Take your son,” God said, “your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah. Offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains, which I will show you.” 
01022003	So Abraham got up early the next morning, saddled his donkey, and took along two of his servants and his son Isaac. He split the wood for a burnt offering and set out for the place God had designated. 
01022004	On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance. 
01022005	“Stay here with the donkey,” Abraham told his servants. “The boy and I will go over there to worship, and then we will return to you.” 
01022006	Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac. He himself carried the fire and the sacrificial knife, and the two of them walked on together. 
01022007	Then Isaac said to his father Abraham, “My father!” “Here I am, my son,” he replied. “The fire and the wood are here,” said Isaac, “but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?” 
01022008	Abraham answered, “God Himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” And the two walked on together. 
01022009	When they arrived at the place God had designated, Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood. He bound his son Isaac and placed him on the altar, atop the wood. 
01022010	Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son. 
01022011	Just then the angel of the LORD called out to him from heaven, “Abraham, Abraham!” “Here I am,” he replied. 
01022012	“Do not lay a hand on the boy or do anything to him,” said the angel, “for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your only son from me.” 
01022013	Then Abraham looked up and saw behind him a ram in a thicket, caught by its horns. So he went and took the ram and offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son. 
01022014	And Abraham called that place The LORD Will Provide. So to this day it is said, “On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided.” 
01022015	And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven a second time, 
01022016	saying, “By Myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, that because you have done this and have not withheld your only son, 
01022017	I will surely bless you, and I will multiply your descendants like the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will possess the gates of their enemies. 
01022018	And through your offspring all nations of the earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.” 
01022019	Abraham went back to his servants, and they got up and set out together for Beersheba. And Abraham settled in Beersheba. 
01022020	Some time later, Abraham was told, “Milcah has also borne sons to your brother Nahor: 
01022021	Uz the firstborn, his brother Buz, Kemuel (the father of Aram), 
01022022	Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” 
01022023	And Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. Milcah bore these eight sons to Abraham’s brother Nahor. 
01022024	Moreover, Nahor’s concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah. 
01023001	Now Sarah lived to be 127 years old. 
01023002	She died in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went out to mourn and to weep for her. 
01023003	Then Abraham got up from beside his dead wife and said to the Hittites, 
01023004	“I am a foreigner and an outsider among you. Give me a burial site among you so that I can bury my dead.” 
01023005	The Hittites replied to Abraham, 
01023006	“Listen to us, sir. You are God’s chosen one among us. Bury your dead in the finest of our tombs. None of us will withhold his tomb for burying your dead.” 
01023007	Then Abraham rose and bowed down before the people of the land, the Hittites. 
01023008	“If you are willing for me to bury my dead,” he said to them, “listen to me, and approach Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf 
01023009	to sell me the cave of Machpelah that belongs to him; it is at the end of his field. Let him sell it to me in your presence for full price, so that I may have a burial site.” 
01023010	Now Ephron was sitting among the sons of Heth. So in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city, Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham, 
01023011	“No, my lord. Listen to me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. I give it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your dead.” 
01023012	Again Abraham bowed down before the people of the land 
01023013	and said to Ephron in their presence, “If you will please listen to me, I will pay you the price of the field. Accept it from me, so that I may bury my dead there.” 
01023014	Ephron answered Abraham, 
01023015	“Listen to me, my lord. The land is worth four hundred shekels of silver, but what is that between you and me? Bury your dead.” 
01023016	Abraham agreed to Ephron’s terms and weighed out for him the price he had named in the hearing of the Hittites: four hundred shekels of silver, according to the standard of the merchants. 
01023017	So Ephron’s field at Machpelah near Mamre, the cave that was in it, and all the trees within the boundaries of the field were deeded over 
01023018	to Abraham’s possession in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city. 
01023019	After this, Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave of the field at Machpelah near Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan. 
01023020	So the field and its cave were deeded by the Hittites to Abraham as a burial site. 
01024001	By now Abraham was old and well along in years, and the LORD had blessed him in every way. 
01024002	So Abraham instructed the chief servant of his household, who managed all he owned, “Place your hand under my thigh, 
01024003	and I will have you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am dwelling, 
01024004	but will go to my country and my kindred to take a wife for my son Isaac.” 
01024005	The servant asked him, “What if the woman is unwilling to follow me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the land from which you came?” 
01024006	Abraham replied, “Make sure that you do not take my son back there. 
01024007	The LORD, the God of heaven, who brought me from my father’s house and my native land, who spoke to me and promised me on oath, saying, ‘To your offspring I will give this land’—He will send His angel before you so that you can take a wife for my son from there. 
01024008	And if the woman is unwilling to follow you, then you are released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there.” 
01024009	So the servant placed his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter. 
01024010	Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and departed with all manner of good things from his master in hand. And he set out for Nahor’s hometown in Aram-naharaim. 
01024011	As evening approached, he made the camels kneel down near the well outside the town at the time when the women went out to draw water. 
01024012	“O LORD, God of my master Abraham,” he prayed, “please grant me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham. 
01024013	Here I am, standing beside the spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water. 
01024014	Now may it happen that the girl to whom I say, ‘Please let down your jar that I may drink,’ and who responds, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels as well’—let her be the one You have appointed for Your servant Isaac. By this I will know that You have shown kindness to my master.” 
01024015	Before the servant had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor. 
01024016	Now the girl was very beautiful, a virgin who had not had relations with any man. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up again. 
01024017	So the servant ran to meet her and said, “Please let me have a little water from your jar.” 
01024018	“Drink, my lord,” she replied, and she quickly lowered her jar to her hands and gave him a drink. 
01024019	After she had given him a drink, she said, “I will also draw water for your camels, until they have had enough to drink.” 
01024020	And she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran back to the well to draw water, until she had drawn water for all his camels. 
01024021	Meanwhile, the man watched her silently to see whether or not the LORD had made his journey a success. 
01024022	And after the camels had finished drinking, he took out a gold ring weighing a beka, and two gold bracelets for her wrists weighing ten shekels. 
01024023	“Whose daughter are you?” he asked. “Please tell me, is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?” 
01024024	She replied, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milcah bore to Nahor.” 
01024025	Then she added, “We have plenty of straw and feed, as well as a place for you to spend the night.” 
01024026	Then the man bowed down and worshiped the LORD, 
01024027	saying, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not withheld His kindness and faithfulness from my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the journey to the house of my master’s relatives.” 
01024028	The girl ran and told her mother’s household about these things. 
01024029	Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he rushed out to the man at the spring. 
01024030	As soon as he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists, and heard Rebekah’s words, “The man said this to me,” he went and found the man standing by the camels near the spring. 
01024031	“Come, you who are blessed by the LORD,” said Laban. “Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.” 
01024032	So the man came to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and feed were brought to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of his companions. 
01024033	Then a meal was set before the man, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told you what I came to say.” So Laban said, “Please speak.” 
01024034	“I am Abraham’s servant,” he replied. 
01024035	“The LORD has greatly blessed my master, and he has become rich. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, menservants and maidservants, camels and donkeys. 
01024036	My master’s wife Sarah has borne him a son in her old age, and my master has given him everything he owns. 
01024037	My master made me swear an oath and said, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites in whose land I dwell, 
01024038	but you shall go to my father’s house and to my kindred to take a wife for my son.’ 
01024039	Then I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not come back with me?’ 
01024040	And he told me, ‘The LORD, before whom I have walked, will send His angel with you and make your journey a success, so that you may take a wife for my son from my kindred and from my father’s house. 
01024041	And when you go to my kindred, if they refuse to give her to you, then you will be released from my oath.’ 
01024042	So when I came to the spring today, I prayed: O LORD, God of my master Abraham, if only You would make my journey a success! 
01024043	Here I am, standing beside this spring. Now if a maiden comes out to draw water and I say to her, ‘Please let me drink a little water from your jar,’ 
01024044	and she replies, ‘Drink, and I will draw water for your camels as well,’ may she be the woman the LORD has appointed for my master’s son. 
01024045	And before I had finished praying in my heart, there was Rebekah coming out with her jar on her shoulder, and she went down to the spring and drew water. So I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’ 
01024046	She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels as well.’ So I drank, and she also watered the camels. 
01024047	Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She replied, ‘The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.’ So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists. 
01024048	Then I bowed down and worshiped the LORD; and I blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who led me on the right road to take the granddaughter of my master’s brother for his son. 
01024049	Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; but if not, let me know, so that I may go elsewhere.” 
01024050	Laban and Bethuel answered, “This is from the LORD; we have no choice in the matter. 
01024051	Rebekah is here before you. Take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master’s son, just as the LORD has decreed.” 
01024052	When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed down to the ground before the LORD. 
01024053	Then he brought out jewels of silver and gold, and articles of clothing, and he gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious gifts to her brother and her mother. 
01024054	Then he and the men with him ate and drank and spent the night there. When they got up the next morning, he said, “Send me on my way to my master.” 
01024055	But her brother and mother said, “Let the girl remain with us ten days or so. After that, she may go.” 
01024056	But he replied, “Do not delay me, since the LORD has made my journey a success. Send me on my way so that I may go to my master.” 
01024057	So they said, “We will call the girl and ask her opinion.” 
01024058	They called Rebekah and asked her, “Will you go with this man?” “I will go,” she replied. 
01024059	So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, along with her nurse and Abraham’s servant and his men. 
01024060	And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, “Our sister, may you become the mother of thousands upon thousands. May your offspring possess the gates of their enemies.” 
01024061	Then Rebekah and her servant girls got ready, mounted the camels, and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left. 
01024062	Now Isaac had just returned from Beer-lahai-roi, for he was living in the Negev. 
01024063	Early in the evening, Isaac went out to the field to meditate, and looking up, he saw the camels approaching. 
01024064	And when Rebekah looked up and saw Isaac, she got down from her camel 
01024065	and asked the servant, “Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?” “It is my master,” the servant answered. So she took her veil and covered herself. 
01024066	Then the servant told Isaac all that he had done. 
01024067	And Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah and took Rebekah as his wife. And Isaac loved her and was comforted after his mother’s death. 
01025001	Now Abraham had taken another wife, named Keturah, 
01025002	and she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 
01025003	Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were the Asshurites, the Letushites, and the Leummites. 
01025004	The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah. 
01025005	Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac. 
01025006	But while he was still alive, Abraham gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east. 
01025007	Abraham lived a total of 175 years. 
01025008	And at a ripe old age he breathed his last and died, old and contented, and was gathered to his people. 
01025009	His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite. 
01025010	This was the field that Abraham had bought from the Hittites. Abraham was buried there with his wife Sarah. 
01025011	After Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac, who lived near Beer-lahai-roi. 
01025012	This is the account of Abraham’s son Ishmael, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maidservant, bore to Abraham. 
01025013	These are the names of the sons of Ishmael in the order of their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 
01025014	Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 
01025015	Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 
01025016	These were the sons of Ishmael, and these were their names by their villages and encampments—twelve princes of their tribes. 
01025017	Ishmael lived a total of 137 years. Then he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people. 
01025018	Ishmael’s descendants settled from Havilah to Shur, which is near the border of Egypt as you go toward Asshur. And they lived in hostility toward all their brothers. 
01025019	This is the account of Abraham’s son Isaac. Abraham became the father of Isaac, 
01025020	and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan-aram and the sister of Laban the Aramean. 
01025021	Later, Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was barren. And the LORD heard his prayer, and his wife Rebekah conceived. 
01025022	But the children inside her struggled with each other, and she said, “Why is this happening to me?” So Rebekah went to inquire of the LORD, 
01025023	and He declared to her: “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will be separated; one people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger.” 
01025024	When her time came to give birth, there were indeed twins in her womb. 
01025025	The first one came out red, covered with hair like a fur coat; so they named him Esau. 
01025026	After this, his brother came out grasping Esau’s heel; so he was named Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when the twins were born. 
01025027	When the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man who stayed at home. 
01025028	Because Isaac had a taste for wild game, he loved Esau; but Rebekah loved Jacob. 
01025029	One day, while Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the field and was famished. 
01025030	He said to Jacob, “Let me eat some of that red stew, for I am famished.” (That is why he was also called Edom.) 
01025031	“First sell me your birthright,” Jacob replied. 
01025032	“Look,” said Esau, “I am about to die, so what good is a birthright to me?” 
01025033	“Swear to me first,” Jacob said. So Esau swore to Jacob and sold him the birthright. 
01025034	Then Jacob gave some bread and lentil stew to Esau, who ate and drank and then got up and went away. Thus Esau despised his birthright. 
01026001	Now there was another famine in the land, subsequent to the one that had occurred in Abraham’s time. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines at Gerar. 
01026002	The LORD appeared to Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt. Settle in the land where I tell you. 
01026003	Stay in this land as a foreigner, and I will be with you and bless you. For I will give all these lands to you and your offspring, and I will confirm the oath that I swore to your father Abraham. 
01026004	I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky, and I will give them all these lands, and through your offspring all nations of the earth will be blessed, 
01026005	because Abraham listened to My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.” 
01026006	So Isaac settled in Gerar. 
01026007	But when the men of that place asked about his wife, he said, “She is my sister.” For he was afraid to say, “She is my wife,” since he thought to himself, “The men of this place will kill me on account of Rebekah, because she is so beautiful.” 
01026008	When Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked down from the window and was surprised to see Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah. 
01026009	Abimelech sent for Isaac and said, “So she is really your wife! How could you say, ‘She is my sister’?” Isaac replied, “Because I thought I might die on account of her.” 
01026010	“What is this you have done to us?” asked Abimelech. “One of the people could easily have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.” 
01026011	So Abimelech warned all the people, saying, “Whoever harms this man or his wife will surely be put to death.” 
01026012	Now Isaac sowed seed in the land, and that very year he reaped a hundredfold. And the LORD blessed him, 
01026013	and he became richer and richer, until he was exceedingly wealthy. 
01026014	He owned so many flocks and herds and servants that the Philistines envied him. 
01026015	So the Philistines took dirt and stopped up all the wells that his father’s servants had dug in the days of his father Abraham. 
01026016	Then Abimelech said to Isaac, “Depart from us, for you are much too powerful for us.” 
01026017	So Isaac left that place and encamped in the Valley of Gerar and settled there. 
01026018	Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the days of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died. And he gave these wells the same names his father had given them. 
01026019	Then Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found a well of fresh water there. 
01026020	But the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen and said, “The water is ours!” So he named the well Esek, because they contended with him. 
01026021	Then they dug another well and quarreled over that one also; so he named it Sitnah. 
01026022	He moved on from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. He named it Rehoboth and said, “At last the LORD has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land.” 
01026023	From there Isaac went up to Beersheba, 
01026024	and that night the LORD appeared to him and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I will bless you and multiply your descendants for the sake of My servant Abraham.” 
01026025	So Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the LORD, and he pitched his tent there. His servants also dug a well there. 
01026026	Later, Abimelech came to Isaac from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army. 
01026027	“Why have you come to me?” Isaac asked them. “You hated me and sent me away.” 
01026028	“We can plainly see that the LORD has been with you,” they replied. “We recommend that there should now be an oath between us and you. Let us make a covenant with you 
01026029	that you will not harm us, just as we have not harmed you but have done only good to you, sending you on your way in peace. And now you are blessed by the LORD.” 
01026030	So Isaac prepared a feast for them, and they ate and drank. 
01026031	And they got up early the next morning and swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they left him in peace. 
01026032	On that same day, Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well they had dug. “We have found water!” they told him. 
01026033	So he called it Shibah, and to this day the name of the city is Beersheba. 
01026034	When Esau was forty years old, he took as his wives Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite and Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite. 
01026035	And they brought grief to Isaac and Rebekah. 
01027001	When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see, he called his older son Esau and said to him, “My son.” “Here I am,” Esau replied. 
01027002	“Look,” said Isaac, “I am now old, and I do not know the day of my death. 
01027003	Take your weapons—your quiver and bow—and go out into the field to hunt some game for me. 
01027004	Then prepare a tasty dish that I love and bring it to me to eat, so that I may bless you before I die.” 
01027005	Now Rebekah was listening to what Isaac told his son Esau. So when Esau went into the field to hunt game and bring it back, 
01027006	Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Behold, I overheard your father saying to your brother Esau, 
01027007	‘Bring me some game and prepare me a tasty dish to eat, so that I may bless you in the presence of the LORD before I die.’ 
01027008	Now, my son, listen to my voice and do exactly as I tell you. 
01027009	Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, so that I can make them into a tasty dish for your father—the kind he loves. 
01027010	Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.” 
01027011	Jacob answered his mother Rebekah, “Look, my brother Esau is a hairy man, but I am smooth-skinned. 
01027012	What if my father touches me? Then I would be revealed to him as a deceiver, and I would bring upon myself a curse rather than a blessing.” 
01027013	His mother replied, “Your curse be on me, my son. Just obey my voice and go get them for me.” 
01027014	So Jacob went and got two goats and brought them to his mother, who made the tasty food his father loved. 
01027015	And Rebekah took the finest clothes in the house that belonged to her older son Esau, and she put them on her younger son Jacob. 
01027016	She also put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck. 
01027017	Then she handed her son Jacob the tasty food and bread she had made. 
01027018	So Jacob went to his father and said, “My father.” “Here I am!” he answered. “Which one are you, my son?” 
01027019	Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau, your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may bless me.” 
01027020	But Isaac asked his son, “How did you ever find it so quickly, my son?” “Because the LORD your God brought it to me,” he replied. 
01027021	Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come closer so I can touch you, my son. Are you really my son Esau, or not?” 
01027022	So Jacob came close to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.” 
01027023	Isaac did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he blessed him. 
01027024	Again he asked, “Are you really my son Esau?” And he replied, “I am.” 
01027025	“Serve me,” said Isaac, “and let me eat some of my son’s game, so that I may bless you.” Jacob brought it to him, and he ate; then he brought him wine, and he drank. 
01027026	Then his father Isaac said to him, “Please come near and kiss me, my son.” 
01027027	So he came near and kissed him. When Isaac smelled his clothing, he blessed him and said: “Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed. 
01027028	May God give to you the dew of heaven and the richness of the earth— an abundance of grain and new wine. 
01027029	May peoples serve you and nations bow down to you. May you be the master of your brothers, and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed, and those who bless you be blessed.” 
01027030	As soon as Isaac had finished blessing him and Jacob had left his father’s presence, his brother Esau returned from the hunt. 
01027031	He too made some tasty food, brought it to his father, and said to him, “My father, sit up and eat of your son’s game, so that you may bless me.” 
01027032	But his father Isaac replied, “Who are you?” “I am Esau, your firstborn son,” he answered. 
01027033	Isaac began to tremble violently and said, “Who was it, then, who hunted the game and brought it to me? Before you came in, I ate it all and blessed him—and indeed, he will be blessed!” 
01027034	When Esau heard his father’s words, he let out a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me too, O my father!” 
01027035	But Isaac replied, “Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.” 
01027036	So Esau declared, “Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has cheated me twice. He took my birthright, and now he has taken my blessing.” Then he asked, “Haven’t you saved a blessing for me?” 
01027037	But Isaac answered Esau: “Look, I have made him your master and given him all his relatives as servants; I have sustained him with grain and new wine. What is left that I can do for you, my son?” 
01027038	Esau said to his father, “Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, O my father!” Then Esau wept aloud. 
01027039	His father Isaac answered him: “Behold, your dwelling place shall be away from the richness of the land, away from the dew of heaven above. 
01027040	You shall live by the sword and serve your brother. But when you rebel, you will tear his yoke from your neck.” 
01027041	Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. And Esau said in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then I will kill my brother Jacob.” 
01027042	When the words of her older son Esau were relayed to Rebekah, she sent for her younger son Jacob and told him, “Look, your brother Esau is consoling himself by plotting to kill you. 
01027043	So now, my son, obey my voice and flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran. 
01027044	Stay with him for a while, until your brother’s fury subsides— 
01027045	until your brother’s rage against you wanes and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send for you and bring you back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?” 
01027046	Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am weary of my life because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a Hittite wife from among them, what good is my life?” 
01028001	So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him. “Do not take a wife from the Canaanite women,” he commanded. 
01028002	“Go at once to Paddan-aram, to the house of your mother’s father Bethuel, and take a wife from among the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother. 
01028003	May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, so that you may become a company of peoples. 
01028004	And may He give the blessing of Abraham to you and your descendants, so that you may possess the land where you dwell as a foreigner, the land God gave to Abraham.” 
01028005	So Isaac sent Jacob to Paddan-aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, who was the mother of Jacob and Esau. 
01028006	Now Esau learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him to Paddan-aram to take a wife there, commanding him, “Do not marry a Canaanite woman,” 
01028007	and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and gone to Paddan-aram. 
01028008	And seeing that his father Isaac disapproved of the Canaanite women, 
01028009	Esau went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Abraham’s son Ishmael, in addition to the wives he already had. 
01028010	Meanwhile Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Haran. 
01028011	On reaching a certain place, he spent the night there because the sun had set. And taking one of the stones from that place, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep. 
01028012	And Jacob had a dream about a ladder that rested on the earth with its top reaching up to heaven, and God’s angels were going up and down the ladder. 
01028013	And there at the top the LORD was standing and saying, “I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you now lie. 
01028014	Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and east and north and south. All the families of the earth will be blessed through you and your offspring. 
01028015	Look, I am with you, and I will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. For I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” 
01028016	When Jacob woke up, he said, “Surely the LORD is in this place, and I was unaware of it.” 
01028017	And he was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven!” 
01028018	Early the next morning, Jacob took the stone that he had placed under his head, and he set it up as a pillar. He poured oil on top of it, 
01028019	and he called that place Bethel, though previously the city had been named Luz. 
01028020	Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and watch over me on this journey, and if He will provide me with food to eat and clothes to wear, 
01028021	so that I may return safely to my father’s house, then the LORD will be my God. 
01028022	And this stone I have set up as a pillar will be God’s house, and of all that You give me I will surely give You a tenth.” 
01029001	Jacob resumed his journey and came to the land of the people of the east. 
01029002	He looked and saw a well in the field, and near it lay three flocks of sheep, because the sheep were watered from this well. And a large stone covered the mouth of the well. 
01029003	When all the flocks had been gathered there, the shepherds would roll away the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep. Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well. 
01029004	“My brothers,” Jacob asked the shepherds, “where are you from?” “We are from Haran,” they answered. 
01029005	“Do you know Laban the grandson of Nahor?” Jacob asked. “We know him,” they replied. 
01029006	“Is he well?” Jacob inquired. “Yes,” they answered, “and here comes his daughter Rachel with his sheep.” 
01029007	“Look,” said Jacob, “it is still broad daylight; it is not yet time to gather the livestock. Water the sheep and take them back to pasture.” 
01029008	But they replied, “We cannot, until all the flocks have been gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep.” 
01029009	While he was still speaking with them, Rachel arrived with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherdess. 
01029010	As soon as Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of his mother’s brother Laban, with Laban’s sheep, he went up and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle’s sheep. 
01029011	Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud. 
01029012	He told Rachel that he was Rebekah’s son, a relative of her father, and she ran and told her father. 
01029013	When Laban heard the news about his sister’s son Jacob, he ran out to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his home, where Jacob told him all that had happened. 
01029014	Then Laban declared, “You are indeed my own flesh and blood.” After Jacob had stayed with him a month, 
01029015	Laban said to him, “Just because you are my relative, should you work for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be.” 
01029016	Now Laban had two daughters; the older was named Leah, and the younger was named Rachel. 
01029017	Leah had weak eyes, but Rachel was shapely and beautiful. 
01029018	Since Jacob loved Rachel, he answered, “I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.” 
01029019	Laban replied, “Better that I give her to you than to another. Stay here with me.” 
01029020	So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, yet it seemed but a few days because of his love for her. 
01029021	Finally Jacob said to Laban, “Grant me my wife, for my time is complete, and I want to sleep with her.” 
01029022	So Laban invited all the men of that place and prepared a feast. 
01029023	But when evening came, Laban took his daughter Leah and gave her to Jacob, and he slept with her. 
01029024	And Laban gave his servant girl Zilpah to his daughter Leah as her maidservant. 
01029025	When morning came, there was Leah! “What have you done to me?” Jacob said to Laban. “Wasn’t it for Rachel that I served you? Why have you deceived me?” 
01029026	Laban replied, “It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older. 
01029027	Finish this week’s celebration, and we will give you the younger one in return for another seven years of work.” 
01029028	And Jacob did just that. He finished the week’s celebration, and Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as his wife. 
01029029	Laban also gave his servant girl Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maidservant. 
01029030	Jacob slept with Rachel as well, and indeed, he loved Rachel more than Leah. So he worked for Laban another seven years. 
01029031	When the LORD saw that Leah was unloved, He opened her womb; but Rachel was barren. 
01029032	And Leah conceived and gave birth to a son, and she named him Reuben, for she said, “The LORD has seen my affliction. Surely my husband will love me now.” 
01029033	Again she conceived and gave birth to a son, and she said, “Because the LORD has heard that I am unloved, He has given me this son as well.” So she named him Simeon. 
01029034	Once again Leah conceived and gave birth to a son, and she said, “Now at last my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.” So he was named Levi. 
01029035	And once more she conceived and gave birth to a son and said, “This time I will praise the LORD.” So she named him Judah. Then Leah stopped having children. 
01030001	When Rachel saw that she was not bearing any children for Jacob, she envied her sister. “Give me children, or I will die!” she said to Jacob. 
01030002	Jacob became angry with Rachel and said, “Am I in the place of God, who has withheld children from you?” 
01030003	Then she said, “Here is my maidservant Bilhah. Sleep with her, that she may bear children for me, so that through her I too can build a family.” 
01030004	So Rachel gave Jacob her servant Bilhah as a wife, and he slept with her, 
01030005	and Bilhah conceived and bore him a son. 
01030006	Then Rachel said, “God has vindicated me; He has heard my plea and given me a son.” So she named him Dan. 
01030007	And Rachel’s servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son. 
01030008	Then Rachel said, “In my great struggles, I have wrestled with my sister and won.” So she named him Naphtali. 
01030009	When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she gave her servant Zilpah to Jacob as a wife. 
01030010	And Leah’s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son. 
01030011	Then Leah said, “How fortunate!” So she named him Gad. 
01030012	When Leah’s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son, 
01030013	Leah said, “How happy I am! For the women call me happy.” So she named him Asher. 
01030014	Now during the wheat harvest, Reuben went out and found some mandrakes in the field. When he brought them to his mother, Rachel begged Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.” 
01030015	But Leah replied, “Is it not enough that you have taken away my husband? Now you want to take my son’s mandrakes as well?” “Very well,” said Rachel, “he may sleep with you tonight in exchange for your son’s mandrakes.” 
01030016	When Jacob came in from the field that evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must come with me, for I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he slept with her that night. 
01030017	And God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore a fifth son to Jacob. 
01030018	Then Leah said, “God has rewarded me for giving my maidservant to my husband.” So she named him Issachar. 
01030019	Again Leah conceived and bore a sixth son to Jacob. 
01030020	“God has given me a good gift,” she said. “This time my husband will honor me, because I have borne him six sons.” And she named him Zebulun. 
01030021	After that, Leah gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah. 
01030022	Then God remembered Rachel. He listened to her and opened her womb, 
01030023	and she conceived and gave birth to a son. “God has taken away my shame,” she said. 
01030024	She named him Joseph, and said, “May the LORD add to me another son.” 
01030025	Now after Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me on my way so I can return to my homeland. 
01030026	Give me my wives and children for whom I have served you, that I may go on my way. You know how hard I have worked for you.” 
01030027	But Laban replied, “If I have found favor in your eyes, please stay. I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you.” 
01030028	And he added, “Name your wages, and I will pay them.” 
01030029	Then Jacob answered, “You know how I have served you and how your livestock have thrived under my care. 
01030030	Indeed, you had very little before my arrival, but now your wealth has increased many times over. The LORD has blessed you wherever I set foot. But now, when may I also provide for my own household?” 
01030031	“What can I give you?” Laban asked. “You do not need to give me anything,” Jacob replied. “If you do this one thing for me, I will keep on shepherding and keeping your flocks. 
01030032	Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb, and every spotted or speckled goat. These will be my wages. 
01030033	So my honesty will testify for me when you come to check on my wages in the future. If I have any goats that are not speckled or spotted, or any lambs that are not dark-colored, they will be considered stolen.” 
01030034	“Agreed,” said Laban. “Let it be as you have said.” 
01030035	That very day Laban removed all the streaked or spotted male goats and every speckled or spotted female goat—every one that had any white on it—and every dark-colored lamb, and he placed them under the care of his sons. 
01030036	Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob was shepherding the rest of Laban’s flocks. 
01030037	Jacob, however, took fresh branches of poplar, almond, and plane trees, and peeled the bark, exposing the white inner wood of the branches. 
01030038	Then he set the peeled branches in the watering troughs in front of the flocks coming in to drink. So when the flocks were in heat and came to drink, 
01030039	they mated in front of the branches. And they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted. 
01030040	Jacob set apart the young, but made the rest face the streaked dark-colored sheep in Laban’s flocks. Then he set his own stock apart and did not put them with Laban’s animals. 
01030041	Whenever the stronger females of the flock were in heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs, in full view of the animals, so that they would breed in front of the branches. 
01030042	But if the animals were weak, he did not set out the branches. So the weaker animals went to Laban and the stronger ones to Jacob. 
01030043	Thus Jacob became exceedingly prosperous. He owned large flocks, maidservants and menservants, and camels and donkeys. 
01031001	Now Jacob heard that Laban’s sons were saying, “Jacob has taken away all that belonged to our father and built all this wealth at our father’s expense.” 
01031002	And Jacob saw from the countenance of Laban that his attitude toward him had changed. 
01031003	Then the LORD said to Jacob, “Go back to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you.” 
01031004	So Jacob sent word and called Rachel and Leah to the field where his flocks were, 
01031005	and he told them, “I can see from your father’s countenance that his attitude toward me has changed; but the God of my father has been with me. 
01031006	You know that I have served your father with all my strength. 
01031007	And although he has cheated me and changed my wages ten times, God has not allowed him to harm me. 
01031008	If he said, ‘The speckled will be your wages,’ then the whole flock bore speckled offspring. If he said, ‘The streaked will be your wages,’ then the whole flock bore streaked offspring. 
01031009	Thus God has taken away your father’s livestock and given them to me. 
01031010	When the flocks were breeding, I saw in a dream that the streaked, spotted, and speckled males were mating with the females. 
01031011	In that dream the angel of God said to me, ‘Jacob!’ And I replied, ‘Here I am.’ 
01031012	‘Look up,’ he said, ‘and see that all the males that are mating with the flock are streaked, spotted, or speckled; for I have seen all that Laban has done to you. 
01031013	I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar and made a solemn vow to Me. Now get up, leave this land at once, and return to your native land.’” 
01031014	And Rachel and Leah replied, “Do we have any portion or inheritance left in our father’s house? 
01031015	Are we not regarded by him as outsiders? Not only has he sold us, but he has certainly squandered what was paid for us. 
01031016	Surely all the wealth that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children. So do whatever God has told you.” 
01031017	Then Jacob got up and put his children and his wives on camels, 
01031018	and he drove all his livestock before him, along with all the possessions he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land in Canaan. 
01031019	Now while Laban was out shearing his sheep, Rachel stole her father’s household idols. 
01031020	Moreover, Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he was running away. 
01031021	So he fled with all his possessions, crossed the Euphrates, and headed for the hill country of Gilead. 
01031022	On the third day Laban was informed that Jacob had fled. 
01031023	So he took his relatives with him, pursued Jacob for seven days, and overtook him in the hill country of Gilead. 
01031024	But that night God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream and warned him, “Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.” 
01031025	Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead when Laban overtook him, and Laban and his relatives camped there as well. 
01031026	Then Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done? You have deceived me and carried off my daughters like captives of war! 
01031027	Why did you run away secretly and deceive me, without even telling me? I would have sent you away with joy and singing, with tambourines and harps. 
01031028	But you did not even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodbye. Now you have done a foolish thing. 
01031029	I have power to do you great harm, but last night the God of your father said to me, ‘Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.’ 
01031030	Now you have gone off because you long for your father’s house. But why have you stolen my gods?” 
01031031	“I was afraid,” Jacob answered, “for I thought you would take your daughters from me by force. 
01031032	If you find your gods with anyone here, he shall not live! In the presence of our relatives, see for yourself if anything is yours, and take it back.” For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the idols. 
01031033	So Laban went into Jacob’s tent, then Leah’s tent, and then the tents of the two maidservants, but he found nothing. Then he left Leah’s tent and entered Rachel’s tent. 
01031034	Now Rachel had taken Laban’s household idols, put them in the saddlebag of her camel, and was sitting on them. And Laban searched everything in the tent but found nothing. 
01031035	Rachel said to her father, “Sir, do not be angry that I cannot stand up before you; for I am having my period.” So Laban searched but could not find the household idols. 
01031036	Then Jacob became incensed and challenged Laban. “What is my crime?” he said. “For what sin of mine have you so hotly pursued me? 
01031037	You have searched all my goods! Have you found anything that belongs to you? Put it here before my brothers and yours, that they may judge between the two of us. 
01031038	I have been with you for twenty years now. Your sheep and goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten the rams of your flock. 
01031039	I did not bring you anything torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you demanded payment from me for what was stolen by day or night. 
01031040	As it was, the heat consumed me by day and the frost by night, and sleep fled from my eyes. 
01031041	Thus for twenty years I have served in your household—fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks—and you have changed my wages ten times! 
01031042	If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, surely by now you would have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands, and last night He rendered judgment.” 
01031043	But Laban answered Jacob, “These daughters are my daughters, these sons are my sons, and these flocks are my flocks! Everything you see is mine! Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine or the children they have borne? 
01031044	Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between you and me.” 
01031045	So Jacob picked out a stone and set it up as a pillar, 
01031046	and he said to his relatives, “Gather some stones.” So they took stones and made a mound, and there by the mound they ate. 
01031047	Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, and Jacob called it Galeed. 
01031048	Then Laban declared, “This mound is a witness between you and me this day.” Therefore the place was called Galeed. 
01031049	It was also called Mizpah, because Laban said, “May the LORD keep watch between you and me when we are absent from each other. 
01031050	If you mistreat my daughters or take other wives, although no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between you and me.” 
01031051	Laban also said to Jacob, “Here is the mound, and here is the pillar I have set up between you and me. 
01031052	This mound is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not go past this mound to harm you, and you will not go past this mound and pillar to harm me. 
01031053	May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac. 
01031054	Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and invited his relatives to eat a meal. And after they had eaten, they spent the night on the mountain. 
01031055	Early the next morning, Laban got up and kissed his grandchildren and daughters and blessed them. Then he left to return home. 
01032001	Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him. 
01032002	When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is the camp of God.” So he named that place Mahanaim. 
01032003	Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom. 
01032004	He instructed them, “You are to say to my master Esau, ‘Your servant Jacob says: I have been staying with Laban and have remained there until now. 
01032005	I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, menservants, and maidservants. I have sent this message to inform my master, so that I may find favor in your sight.’” 
01032006	When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you—he and four hundred men with him.” 
01032007	In great fear and distress, Jacob divided his people into two camps, as well as the flocks and herds and camels. 
01032008	He thought, “If Esau comes and attacks one camp, then the other camp can escape.” 
01032009	Then Jacob declared, “O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, the LORD who told me, ‘Go back to your country and to your kindred, and I will make you prosper,’ 
01032010	I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness You have shown Your servant. Indeed, with only my staff I came across the Jordan, but now I have become two camps. 
01032011	Please deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid that he may come and attack me and the mothers and children with me. 
01032012	But You have said, ‘I will surely make you prosper, and I will make your offspring like the sand of the sea, too numerous to count.’” 
01032013	Jacob spent the night there, and from what he had brought with him, he selected a gift for his brother Esau: 
01032014	200 female goats, 20 male goats, 200 ewes, 20 rams, 
01032015	30 milk camels with their young, 40 cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys, and 10 male donkeys. 
01032016	He entrusted them to his servants in separate herds and told them, “Go on ahead of me, and keep some distance between the herds.” 
01032017	He instructed the one in the lead, “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘To whom do you belong, where are you going, and whose animals are these before you?’ 
01032018	then you are to say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift, sent to my lord Esau. And behold, Jacob is behind us.’” 
01032019	He also instructed the second, the third, and all those following behind the herds: “When you meet Esau, you are to say the same thing to him. 
01032020	You are also to say, ‘Look, your servant Jacob is right behind us.’” For he thought, “I will appease Esau with the gift that is going before me. After that I can face him, and perhaps he will accept me.” 
01032021	So Jacob’s gifts went on before him, while he spent the night in the camp. 
01032022	During the night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two maidservants, and his eleven sons, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. 
01032023	He took them and sent them across the stream, along with all his possessions. 
01032024	So Jacob was left all alone, and there a man wrestled with him until daybreak. 
01032025	When the man saw that he could not overpower Jacob, he struck the socket of Jacob’s hip and dislocated it as they wrestled. 
01032026	Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.” But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.” 
01032027	“What is your name?” the man asked. “Jacob,” he replied. 
01032028	Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with men, and you have prevailed.” 
01032029	And Jacob requested, “Please tell me your name.” But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?” Then he blessed Jacob there. 
01032030	So Jacob named the place Peniel, saying, “Indeed, I have seen God face to face, and yet my life was spared.” 
01032031	The sun rose above him as he passed by Penuel, and he was limping because of his hip. 
01032032	Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob’s hip was struck near that tendon. 
01033001	Now Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming toward him with four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants. 
01033002	He put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear. 
01033003	But Jacob himself went on ahead and bowed to the ground seven times as he approached his brother. 
01033004	Esau, however, ran to him and embraced him, threw his arms around his neck, and kissed him. And they both wept. 
01033005	When Esau looked up and saw the women and children, he asked, “Who are these with you?” Jacob answered, “These are the children God has graciously given your servant.” 
01033006	Then the maidservants and their children approached and bowed down. 
01033007	Leah and her children also approached and bowed down, and then Joseph and Rachel approached and bowed down. 
01033008	“What do you mean by sending this whole company to meet me?” asked Esau. “To find favor in your sight, my lord,” Jacob answered. 
01033009	“I already have plenty, my brother,” Esau replied. “Keep what belongs to you.” 
01033010	But Jacob insisted, “No, please! If I have found favor in your sight, then receive this gift from my hand. For indeed, I have seen your face, and it is like seeing the face of God, since you have received me favorably. 
01033011	Please accept my gift that was brought to you, because God has been gracious to me and I have all I need.” So Jacob pressed him until he accepted. 
01033012	Then Esau said, “Let us be on our way, and I will go ahead of you.” 
01033013	But Jacob replied, “My lord knows that the children are frail, and I must care for sheep and cattle that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard for even a day, all the animals will die. 
01033014	Please let my lord go ahead of his servant. I will continue on slowly, at a comfortable pace for the livestock and children, until I come to my lord at Seir.” 
01033015	“Let me leave some of my people with you,” Esau said. But Jacob replied, “Why do that? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.” 
01033016	So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir, 
01033017	but Jacob went on to Succoth, where he built a house for himself and shelters for his livestock; that is why the place was called Succoth. 
01033018	After Jacob had come from Paddan-aram, he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan, and he camped just outside the city. 
01033019	And the plot of ground where he pitched his tent, he purchased from the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of silver. 
01033020	There he set up an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel. 
01034001	Now Dinah, the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the daughters of the land. 
01034002	When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the region, saw her, he took her and lay with her by force. 
01034003	And his soul was drawn to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob. He loved the young girl and spoke to her tenderly. 
01034004	So Shechem told his father Hamor, “Get me this girl as a wife.” 
01034005	Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled his daughter Dinah, but since his sons were with his livestock in the field, he remained silent about it until they returned. 
01034006	Meanwhile, Shechem’s father Hamor came to speak with Jacob. 
01034007	When Jacob’s sons heard what had happened, they returned from the field. They were filled with grief and fury, because Shechem had committed an outrage in Israel by lying with Jacob’s daughter—a thing that should not be done. 
01034008	But Hamor said to them, “My son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife. 
01034009	Intermarry with us; give us your daughters and take our daughters for yourselves. 
01034010	You may settle among us, and the land will be open to you. Live here, move about freely, and acquire your own property.” 
01034011	Then Shechem said to Dinah’s father and brothers, “Grant me this favor, and I will give you whatever you ask. 
01034012	Demand a high dowry and an expensive gift, and I will give you whatever you ask. Only give me the girl as my wife!” 
01034013	But because Shechem had defiled their sister Dinah, Jacob’s sons answered him and his father Hamor deceitfully. 
01034014	“We cannot do such a thing,” they said. “To give our sister to an uncircumcised man would be a disgrace to us. 
01034015	We will consent to this on one condition, that you become circumcised like us—every one of your males. 
01034016	Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves. We will dwell among you and become one people. 
01034017	But if you will not agree to be circumcised, then we will take our sister and go.” 
01034018	Their offer seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem. 
01034019	The young man, who was the most respected of all his father’s household, did not hesitate to fulfill this request, because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter. 
01034020	So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city and addressed the men of their city: 
01034021	“These men are at peace with us. Let them live and trade in our land; indeed, it is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters in marriage and give our daughters to them. 
01034022	But only on this condition will the men agree to dwell with us and be one people: if all our men are circumcised as they are. 
01034023	Will not their livestock, their possessions, and all their animals become ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will dwell among us.” 
01034024	All the men who went out of the city gate listened to Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male of the city was circumcised. 
01034025	Three days later, while they were still in pain, two of Jacob’s sons (Dinah’s brothers Simeon and Levi) took their swords, went into the unsuspecting city, and slaughtered every male. 
01034026	They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with their swords, took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went away. 
01034027	Jacob’s other sons came upon the slaughter and looted the city, because their sister had been defiled. 
01034028	They took their flocks and herds and donkeys, and everything else in the city or in the field. 
01034029	They carried off all their possessions and women and children, and they plundered everything in their houses. 
01034030	Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble upon me by making me a stench to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people of this land. We are few in number; if they unite against me and attack me, I and my household will be destroyed.” 
01034031	But they replied, “Should he have treated our sister like a prostitute?” 
01035001	Then God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel, and settle there. Build an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.” 
01035002	So Jacob told his household and all who were with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods that are among you. Purify yourselves and change your garments. 
01035003	Then let us arise and go to Bethel. I will build an altar there to God, who answered me in my day of distress. He has been with me wherever I have gone.” 
01035004	So they gave Jacob all their foreign gods and all their earrings, and Jacob buried them under the oak near Shechem. 
01035005	As they set out, a terror from God fell over the surrounding cities, so that they did not pursue Jacob’s sons. 
01035006	So Jacob and everyone with him arrived in Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan. 
01035007	There Jacob built an altar, and he called that place El-bethel, because it was there that God had revealed Himself to Jacob as he fled from his brother. 
01035008	Now Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died and was buried under the oak below Bethel. So Jacob named it Allon-bachuth. 
01035009	After Jacob had returned from Paddan-aram, God appeared to him again and blessed him. 
01035010	And God said to him, “Though your name is Jacob, you will no longer be called Jacob. Instead, your name will be Israel.” So God named him Israel. 
01035011	And God told him, “I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation—even a company of nations—shall come from you, and kings shall descend from you. 
01035012	The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give this land to your descendants after you.” 
01035013	Then God went up from the place where He had spoken with him. 
01035014	So Jacob set up a pillar in the place where God had spoken with him—a stone marker—and he poured out a drink offering on it and anointed it with oil. 
01035015	Jacob called the place where God had spoken with him Bethel. 
01035016	Later, they set out from Bethel, and while they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth, and her labor was difficult. 
01035017	During her severe labor, the midwife said to her, “Do not be afraid, for you are having another son.” 
01035018	And with her last breath—for she was dying—she named him Ben-oni. But his father called him Benjamin. 
01035019	So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). 
01035020	Jacob set up a pillar on her grave; it marks Rachel’s tomb to this day. 
01035021	Israel again set out and pitched his tent beyond the Tower of Eder. 
01035022	While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father’s concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard about it. Jacob had twelve sons: 
01035023	The sons of Leah were Reuben the firstborn of Jacob, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. 
01035024	The sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin. 
01035025	The sons of Rachel’s maidservant Bilhah were Dan and Naphtali. 
01035026	And the sons of Leah’s maidservant Zilpah were Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan-aram. 
01035027	Jacob returned to his father Isaac at Mamre, near Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed. 
01035028	And Isaac lived 180 years. 
01035029	Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, old and full of years. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him. 
01036001	This is the account of Esau (that is, Edom). 
01036002	Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite, Oholibamah daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite, 
01036003	and Basemath daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth. 
01036004	And Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath gave birth to Reuel, 
01036005	and Oholibamah gave birth to Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These were the sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan. 
01036006	Later, Esau took his wives and sons and daughters and all the people of his household, along with his livestock, all his other animals, and all the property he had acquired in Canaan, and he moved to a land far away from his brother Jacob. 
01036007	For their possessions were too great for them to dwell together; the land where they stayed could not support them because of their livestock. 
01036008	So Esau (that is, Edom) settled in the area of Mount Seir. 
01036009	This is the account of Esau, the father of the Edomites, in the area of Mount Seir. 
01036010	These are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz son of Esau’s wife Adah, and Reuel son of Esau’s wife Basemath. 
01036011	The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz. 
01036012	Additionally, Timna, a concubine of Esau’s son Eliphaz, gave birth to Amalek. These are the grandsons of Esau’s wife Adah. 
01036013	These are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. They are the grandsons of Esau’s wife Basemath. 
01036014	These are the sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah (daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon) whom she bore to Esau: Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. 
01036015	These are the chiefs among the sons of Esau. The sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau: Chiefs Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz, 
01036016	Korah, Gatam, and Amalek. They are the chiefs of Eliphaz in the land of Edom, and they are the grandsons of Adah. 
01036017	These are the sons of Esau’s son Reuel: Chiefs Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. They are the chiefs descended from Reuel in the land of Edom, and they are the grandsons of Esau’s wife Basemath. 
01036018	These are the sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah: Chiefs Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. They are the chiefs descended from Esau’s wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah. 
01036019	All these are the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and they were their chiefs. 
01036020	These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who were living in the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 
01036021	Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. They are the chiefs of the Horites, the descendants of Seir in the land of Edom. 
01036022	The sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam. Timna was Lotan’s sister. 
01036023	These are the sons of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. 
01036024	These are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah. (This is the Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness as he was pasturing the donkeys of his father Zibeon.) 
01036025	These are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah daughter of Anah. 
01036026	These are the sons of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran. 
01036027	These are the sons of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan. 
01036028	These are the sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran. 
01036029	These are the chiefs of the Horites: Chiefs Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 
01036030	Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. They are the chiefs of the Horites, according to their divisions in the land of Seir. 
01036031	These are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the Israelites: 
01036032	Bela son of Beor reigned in Edom; the name of his city was Dinhabah. 
01036033	When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah reigned in his place. 
01036034	When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites reigned in his place. 
01036035	When Husham died, Hadad son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the country of Moab, reigned in his place. And the name of his city was Avith. 
01036036	When Hadad died, Samlah from Masrekah reigned in his place. 
01036037	When Samlah died, Shaul from Rehoboth on the Euphrates reigned in his place. 
01036038	When Shaul died, Baal-hanan son of Achbor reigned in his place. 
01036039	When Baal-hanan son of Achbor died, Hadad reigned in his place. His city was named Pau, and his wife’s name was Mehetabel daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-zahab. 
01036040	These are the names of Esau’s chiefs, according to their families and regions, by their names: Chiefs Timna, Alvah, Jetheth, 
01036041	Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon, 
01036042	Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar, 
01036043	Magdiel, and Iram. These were the chiefs of Edom, according to their settlements in the land they possessed. Esau was the father of the Edomites. 
01037001	Now Jacob lived in the land where his father had resided, the land of Canaan. 
01037002	This is the account of Jacob. When Joseph was seventeen years old, he was tending the flock with his brothers, the sons of his father’s wives Bilhah and Zilpah, and he brought their father a bad report about them. 
01037003	Now Israel loved Joseph more than his other sons, because Joseph had been born to him in his old age; so he made him a robe of many colors. 
01037004	When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him. 
01037005	Then Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more. 
01037006	He said to them, “Listen to this dream I had: 
01037007	We were binding sheaves of grain in the field, and suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to mine.” 
01037008	“Do you intend to reign over us?” his brothers asked. “Will you actually rule us?” So they hated him even more because of his dream and his statements. 
01037009	Then Joseph had another dream and told it to his brothers. “Look,” he said, “I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.” 
01037010	He told his father and brothers, but his father rebuked him and said, “What is this dream that you have had? Will your mother and brothers and I actually come and bow down to the ground before you?” 
01037011	And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept in mind what he had said. 
01037012	Some time later, Joseph’s brothers had gone to pasture their father’s flocks near Shechem. 
01037013	Israel said to him, “Are not your brothers pasturing the flocks at Shechem? Get ready; I am sending you to them.” “I am ready,” Joseph replied. 
01037014	Then Israel told him, “Go now and see how your brothers and the flocks are faring, and bring word back to me.” So he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron. And when Joseph arrived in Shechem, 
01037015	a man found him wandering in the field and asked, “What are you looking for?” 
01037016	“I am looking for my brothers,” Joseph replied. “Can you please tell me where they are pasturing their flocks?” 
01037017	“They have moved on from here,” the man answered. “I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’” So Joseph set out after his brothers and found them at Dothan. 
01037018	Now Joseph’s brothers saw him in the distance, and before he arrived, they plotted to kill him. 
01037019	“Here comes that dreamer!” they said to one another. 
01037020	“Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits. We can say that a vicious animal has devoured him. Then we shall see what becomes of his dreams!” 
01037021	When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue Joseph from their hands. “Let us not take his life,” he said. 
01037022	“Do not shed his blood. Throw him into this pit in the wilderness, but do not lay a hand on him.” Reuben said this so that he could rescue Joseph from their hands and return him to his father. 
01037023	So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe—the robe of many colors he was wearing— 
01037024	and they took him and threw him into the pit. Now the pit was empty, with no water in it. 
01037025	And as they sat down to eat a meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were carrying spices, balm, and myrrh on their way down to Egypt. 
01037026	Then Judah said to his brothers, “What profit will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood? 
01037027	Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay a hand on him; for he is our brother, our own flesh.” And they agreed. 
01037028	So when the Midianite traders passed by, his brothers pulled Joseph out of the pit and sold him for twenty shekels of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt. 
01037029	When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes, 
01037030	returned to his brothers, and said, “The boy is gone! What am I going to do?” 
01037031	Then they took Joseph’s robe, slaughtered a young goat, and dipped the robe in its blood. 
01037032	They sent the robe of many colors to their father and said, “We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son’s robe or not.” 
01037033	His father recognized it and said, “It is my son’s robe! A vicious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces!” 
01037034	Then Jacob tore his clothes, put sackcloth around his waist, and mourned for his son many days. 
01037035	All his sons and daughters tried to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. “No,” he said. “I will go down to Sheol mourning for my son.” So his father wept for him. 
01037036	Meanwhile, the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard. 
01038001	About that time, Judah left his brothers and settled near a man named Hirah, an Adullamite. 
01038002	There Judah saw the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua, and he took her as a wife and slept with her. 
01038003	So she conceived and gave birth to a son, and Judah named him Er. 
01038004	Again she conceived and gave birth to a son, and she named him Onan. 
01038005	Then she gave birth to another son and named him Shelah; it was at Chezib that she gave birth to him. 
01038006	Now Judah acquired a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. 
01038007	But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; so the LORD put him to death. 
01038008	Then Judah said to Onan, “Sleep with your brother’s wife. Perform your duty as her brother-in-law and raise up offspring for your brother.” 
01038009	But Onan knew that the offspring would not belong to him; so whenever he would sleep with his brother’s wife, he would spill his seed on the ground so that he would not produce offspring for his brother. 
01038010	What he did was wicked in the sight of the LORD, so He put Onan to death as well. 
01038011	Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Live as a widow in your father’s house until my son Shelah grows up.” For he thought, “He may die too, like his brothers.” So Tamar went to live in her father’s house. 
01038012	After a long time Judah’s wife, the daughter of Shua, died. When Judah had finished mourning, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah. 
01038013	When Tamar was told, “Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep,” 
01038014	she removed her widow’s garments, covered her face with a veil to disguise herself, and sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah. For she saw that although Shelah had grown up, she had not been given to him as a wife. 
01038015	When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute because she had covered her face. 
01038016	Not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her and said, “Come now, let me sleep with you.” “What will you give me for sleeping with you?” she inquired. 
01038017	“I will send you a young goat from my flock,” Judah answered. But she replied, “Only if you leave me something as a pledge until you send it.” 
01038018	“What pledge should I give you?” he asked. She answered, “Your seal and your cord, and the staff in your hand.” So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she became pregnant by him. 
01038019	Then Tamar got up and departed. And she removed her veil and put on her widow’s garments again. 
01038020	Now when Judah sent his friend Hirah the Adullamite with the young goat to collect the items he had left with the woman, he could not find her. 
01038021	He asked the men of that place, “Where is the shrine prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim?” “No shrine prostitute has been here,” they answered. 
01038022	So Hirah returned to Judah and said, “I could not find her, and furthermore, the men of that place said, ‘No shrine prostitute has been here.’” 
01038023	“Let her keep the items,” Judah replied. “Otherwise we will become a laughingstock. After all, I did send her this young goat, but you could not find her.” 
01038024	About three months later, Judah was told, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar has prostituted herself, and now she is pregnant.” “Bring her out!” Judah replied. “Let her be burned to death!” 
01038025	As she was being brought out, Tamar sent a message to her father-in-law: “I am pregnant by the man to whom these items belong.” And she added, “Please examine them. Whose seal and cord and staff are these?” 
01038026	Judah recognized the items and said, “She is more righteous than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah.” And he did not have relations with her again. 
01038027	When the time came for Tamar to give birth, there were twins in her womb. 
01038028	And as she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand; so the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it around his wrist. “This one came out first,” she announced. 
01038029	But when he pulled his hand back and his brother came out, she said, “You have broken out first!” So he was named Perez. 
01038030	Then his brother came out with the scarlet thread around his wrist, and he was named Zerah. 
01039001	Meanwhile, Joseph had been taken down to Egypt, where an Egyptian named Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there. 
01039002	And the LORD was with Joseph, and he became a successful man, serving in the household of his Egyptian master. 
01039003	When his master saw that the LORD was with him and made him prosper in all he did, 
01039004	Joseph found favor in his sight and became his personal attendant. Potiphar put him in charge of his household and entrusted him with everything he owned. 
01039005	From the time that he put Joseph in charge of his household and all he owned, the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s household on account of him. The LORD’s blessing was on everything he owned, both in his house and in his field. 
01039006	So Potiphar left all that he owned in Joseph’s care; he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. Now Joseph was well-built and handsome, 
01039007	and after some time his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and said, “Sleep with me.” 
01039008	But he refused. “Look,” he said to his master’s wife, “with me here, my master does not concern himself with anything in his house, and he has entrusted everything he owns to my care. 
01039009	No one in this house is greater than I am. He has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. So how could I do such a great evil and sin against God?” 
01039010	Although Potiphar’s wife spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be near her. 
01039011	One day, however, Joseph went into the house to attend to his work, and not a single household servant was inside. 
01039012	She grabbed Joseph by his cloak and said, “Sleep with me!” But leaving his cloak in her hand, he escaped and ran outside. 
01039013	When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house, 
01039014	she called her household servants. “Look,” she said, “this Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us. He came to me so he could sleep with me, but I screamed as loud as I could. 
01039015	When he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.” 
01039016	So Potiphar’s wife kept Joseph’s cloak beside her until his master came home. 
01039017	Then she told him the same story: “The Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me, 
01039018	but when I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.” 
01039019	When his master heard the story his wife told him, saying, “This is what your slave did to me,” he burned with anger. 
01039020	So Joseph’s master took him and had him thrown into the prison where the king’s prisoners were confined. While Joseph was there in the prison, 
01039021	the LORD was with him and extended kindness to him, granting him favor in the eyes of the prison warden. 
01039022	And the warden put all the prisoners under Joseph’s care, so that he was responsible for all that was done in the prison. 
01039023	The warden did not concern himself with anything under Joseph’s care, because the LORD was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did. 
01040001	Some time later, the king’s cupbearer and baker offended their master, the king of Egypt. 
01040002	Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker, 
01040003	and imprisoned them in the house of the captain of the guard, the same prison where Joseph was confined. 
01040004	The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he became their personal attendant. After they had been in custody for some time, 
01040005	both of these men—the Egyptian king’s cupbearer and baker, who were being held in the prison—had a dream on the same night, and each dream had its own meaning. 
01040006	When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were distraught. 
01040007	So he asked the officials of Pharaoh who were in custody with him in his master’s house, “Why are your faces so downcast today?” 
01040008	“We both had dreams,” they replied, “but there is no one to interpret them.” Then Joseph said to them, “Don’t interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams.” 
01040009	So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream: “In my dream there was a vine before me, 
01040010	and on the vine were three branches. As it budded, its blossoms opened and its clusters ripened into grapes. 
01040011	Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into his cup, and placed the cup in his hand.” 
01040012	Joseph replied, “This is the interpretation: The three branches are three days. 
01040013	Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore your position. You will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand, just as you did when you were his cupbearer. 
01040014	But when it goes well for you, please remember me and show me kindness by mentioning me to Pharaoh, that he might bring me out of this prison. 
01040015	For I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing for which they should have put me in this dungeon.” 
01040016	When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, “I too had a dream: There were three baskets of white bread on my head. 
01040017	In the top basket were all sorts of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.” 
01040018	Joseph replied, “This is the interpretation: The three baskets are three days. 
01040019	Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and hang you on a tree. Then the birds will eat the flesh of your body.” 
01040020	On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he held a feast for all his officials, and in their presence he lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker. 
01040021	Pharaoh restored the chief cupbearer to his position, so that he once again placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand. 
01040022	But Pharaoh hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had described to them in his interpretation. 
01040023	The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot all about him. 
01041001	After two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream: He was standing beside the Nile, 
01041002	when seven cows, sleek and well-fed, came up from the river and began to graze among the reeds. 
01041003	After them, seven other cows, sickly and thin, came up from the Nile and stood beside the well-fed cows on the bank of the river. 
01041004	And the cows that were sickly and thin devoured the seven sleek, well-fed cows. Then Pharaoh woke up, 
01041005	but he fell back asleep and dreamed a second time: Seven heads of grain, plump and ripe, came up on one stalk. 
01041006	After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted, thin and scorched by the east wind. 
01041007	And the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven plump, ripe ones. Then Pharaoh awoke and realized it was a dream. 
01041008	In the morning his spirit was troubled, so he summoned all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him. 
01041009	Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “Today I recall my failures. 
01041010	Pharaoh was once angry with his servants, and he put me and the chief baker in the custody of the captain of the guard. 
01041011	One night both the chief baker and I had dreams, and each dream had its own meaning. 
01041012	Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams and he interpreted them for us individually. 
01041013	And it happened to us just as he had interpreted: I was restored to my position, and the other man was hanged.” 
01041014	So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, who was quickly brought out of the dungeon. After he had shaved and changed his clothes, he went in before Pharaoh. 
01041015	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.” 
01041016	“I myself cannot do it,” Joseph replied, “but God will give Pharaoh a sound answer.” 
01041017	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph: “In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile, 
01041018	when seven cows, well-fed and sleek, came up from the river and began to graze among the reeds. 
01041019	After them, seven other cows—sickly, ugly, and thin—came up. I have never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt! 
01041020	Then the thin, ugly cows devoured the seven well-fed cows that were there first. 
01041021	When they had devoured them, however, no one could tell that they had done so; their appearance was as ugly as it had been before. Then I awoke. 
01041022	In my dream I also saw seven heads of grain, plump and ripe, growing on a single stalk. 
01041023	After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted—withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind. 
01041024	And the thin heads of grain swallowed the seven plump ones. I told this dream to the magicians, but no one could explain it to me.” 
01041025	At this, Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what He is about to do. 
01041026	The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven ripe heads of grain are seven years. The dreams have the same meaning. 
01041027	Moreover, the seven thin, ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind—they are seven years of famine. 
01041028	It is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do. 
01041029	Behold, seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt, 
01041030	but seven years of famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will devastate the land. 
01041031	The abundance in the land will not be remembered, since the famine that follows it will be so severe. 
01041032	Moreover, because the dream was given to Pharaoh in two versions, the matter has been decreed by God, and He will carry it out shortly. 
01041033	Now, therefore, Pharaoh should look for a discerning and wise man and set him over the land of Egypt. 
01041034	Let Pharaoh take action and appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance. 
01041035	Under the authority of Pharaoh, let them collect all the excess food from these good years, that they may come and lay up the grain to be preserved as food in the cities. 
01041036	This food will be a reserve for the land during the seven years of famine to come upon the land of Egypt. Then the country will not perish in the famine.” 
01041037	This proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his officials. 
01041038	So Pharaoh asked them, “Can we find anyone like this man, in whom the Spirit of God abides?” 
01041039	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one as discerning and wise as you. 
01041040	You shall be in charge of my house, and all my people are to obey your commands. Only with regard to the throne will I be greater than you.” 
01041041	Pharaoh also told Joseph, “I hereby place you over all the land of Egypt.” 
01041042	Then Pharaoh removed the signet ring from his finger, put it on Joseph’s finger, clothed him in garments of fine linen, and placed a gold chain around his neck. 
01041043	He had Joseph ride in his second chariot, with men calling out before him, “Bow the knee!” So he placed him over all the land of Egypt. 
01041044	And Pharaoh declared to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, but without your permission, no one in all the land of Egypt shall lift his hand or foot.” 
01041045	Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-paneah, and he gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, to be his wife. And Joseph took charge of all the land of Egypt. 
01041046	Now Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph left Pharaoh’s presence and traveled throughout the land of Egypt. 
01041047	During the seven years of abundance, the land brought forth bountifully. 
01041048	During those seven years, Joseph collected all the excess food in the land of Egypt and stored it in the cities. In every city he laid up the food from the fields around it. 
01041049	So Joseph stored up grain in such abundance, like the sand of the sea, that he stopped keeping track of it; for it was beyond measure. 
01041050	Before the years of famine arrived, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. 
01041051	Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh, saying, “God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father’s household.” 
01041052	And the second son he named Ephraim, saying, “God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.” 
01041053	When the seven years of abundance in the land of Egypt came to an end, 
01041054	the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. And although there was famine in every country, there was food throughout the land of Egypt. 
01041055	When extreme hunger came to all the land of Egypt and the people cried out to Pharaoh for food, he told all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph and do whatever he tells you.” 
01041056	When the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened up all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians; for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt. 
01041057	And every nation came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth. 
01042001	When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why are you staring at one another?” 
01042002	“Look,” he added, “I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die.” 
01042003	So ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. 
01042004	But Jacob did not send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he said, “I am afraid that harm might befall him.” 
01042005	So the sons of Israel were among those who came to buy grain, since the famine had also spread to the land of Canaan. 
01042006	Now Joseph was the ruler of the land; he was the one who sold grain to all its people. So when his brothers arrived, they bowed down before him with their faces to the ground. 
01042007	And when Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he treated them as strangers and spoke harshly to them. “Where have you come from?” he asked. “From the land of Canaan,” they replied. “We are here to buy food.” 
01042008	Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him. 
01042009	Joseph remembered his dreams about them and said, “You are spies! You have come to see if our land is vulnerable.” 
01042010	“Not so, my lord,” they replied. “Your servants have come to buy food. 
01042011	We are all sons of one man. Your servants are honest men, not spies.” 
01042012	“No,” he told them. “You have come to see if our land is vulnerable.” 
01042013	But they answered, “Your servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father, and one is no more.” 
01042014	Then Joseph declared, “Just as I said, you are spies! 
01042015	And this is how you will be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here. 
01042016	Send one of your number to get your brother; the rest of you will be confined so that the truth of your words may be tested. If they are untrue, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!” 
01042017	So Joseph imprisoned them for three days, 
01042018	and on the third day he said to them, “I fear God. So do this and you will live: 
01042019	If you are honest, leave one of your brothers in custody while the rest of you go and take back grain to relieve the hunger of your households. 
01042020	Then bring your youngest brother to me so that your words can be verified, that you may not die.” And to this they consented. 
01042021	Then they said to one another, “Surely we are being punished because of our brother. We saw his anguish when he pleaded with us, but we would not listen. That is why this distress has come upon us.” 
01042022	And Reuben responded, “Didn’t I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you would not listen. Now we must account for his blood!” 
01042023	They did not realize that Joseph understood them, since there was an interpreter between them. 
01042024	And he turned away from them and wept. When he turned back and spoke to them, he took Simeon from them and had him bound before their eyes. 
01042025	Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to return each man’s silver to his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey. This order was carried out, 
01042026	and they loaded the grain on their donkeys and departed. 
01042027	At the place where they lodged for the night, one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw his silver in the mouth of the sack. 
01042028	“My silver has been returned!” he said to his brothers. “It is here in my sack.” Their hearts sank, and trembling, they turned to one another and said, “What is this that God has done to us?” 
01042029	When they reached their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they described to him all that had happened to them: 
01042030	“The man who is lord of the land spoke harshly to us and accused us of spying on the country. 
01042031	But we told him, ‘We are honest men, not spies. 
01042032	We are twelve brothers, sons of one father. One is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in the land of Canaan.’ 
01042033	Then the man who is lord of the land said to us, ‘This is how I will know whether you are honest: Leave one brother with me, take food to relieve the hunger of your households, and go. 
01042034	But bring your youngest brother back to me so I will know that you are not spies but honest men. Then I will give your brother back to you, and you can trade in the land.’” 
01042035	As they began emptying their sacks, there in each man’s sack was his bag of silver! And when they and their father saw the bags of silver, they were dismayed. 
01042036	Their father Jacob said to them, “You have deprived me of my sons. Joseph is gone and Simeon is no more. Now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is going against me!” 
01042037	Then Reuben said to his father, “You may kill my two sons if I fail to bring him back to you. Put him in my care, and I will return him.” 
01042038	But Jacob replied, “My son will not go down there with you, for his brother is dead, and he alone is left. If any harm comes to him on your journey, you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow.” 
01043001	Now the famine was still severe in the land. 
01043002	So when Jacob’s sons had eaten all the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go back and buy us a little more food.” 
01043003	But Judah replied, “The man solemnly warned us, ‘You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.’ 
01043004	If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy food for you. 
01043005	But if you will not send him, we will not go; for the man told us, ‘You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.’” 
01043006	“Why did you bring this trouble upon me?” Israel asked. “Why did you tell the man you had another brother?” 
01043007	They replied, “The man questioned us in detail about ourselves and our family: ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?’ And we answered him accordingly. How could we possibly know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother here’?” 
01043008	And Judah said to his father Israel, “Send the boy with me, and we will go at once, so that we may live and not die—neither we, nor you, nor our children. 
01043009	I will guarantee his safety. You may hold me personally responsible. If I do not bring him back and set him before you, then may I bear the guilt before you all my life. 
01043010	If we had not delayed, we could have come and gone twice by now.” 
01043011	Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: Put some of the best products of the land in your packs and carry them down as a gift for the man—a little balm and a little honey, spices and myrrh, pistachios and almonds. 
01043012	Take double the silver with you so that you may return the silver that was put back into the mouths of your sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake. 
01043013	Take your brother as well, and return to the man at once. 
01043014	May God Almighty grant you mercy before the man, that he may release your other brother along with Benjamin. As for me, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved.” 
01043015	So the men took these gifts, along with double the amount of silver, and Benjamin as well. Then they hurried down to Egypt and stood before Joseph. 
01043016	When Joseph saw Benjamin with his brothers, he said to the steward of his house, “Take these men to my house. Slaughter an animal and prepare it, for they shall dine with me at noon.” 
01043017	The man did as Joseph had commanded and took the brothers to Joseph’s house. 
01043018	But the brothers were frightened that they had been taken to Joseph’s house. “We have been brought here because of the silver that was returned in our bags the first time,” they said. “They intend to overpower us and take us as slaves, along with our donkeys.” 
01043019	So they approached Joseph’s steward and spoke to him at the entrance to the house. 
01043020	“Please, sir,” they said, “we really did come down here the first time to buy food. 
01043021	But when we came to the place we lodged for the night, we opened our sacks and, behold, each of us found his silver in the mouth of his sack! It was the full amount of our silver, and we have brought it back with us. 
01043022	We have brought additional silver with us to buy food. We do not know who put our silver in our sacks.” 
01043023	“It is fine,” said the steward. “Do not be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, gave you the treasure that was in your sacks. I received your silver.” Then he brought Simeon out to them. 
01043024	And the steward took the men into Joseph’s house, gave them water to wash their feet, and provided food for their donkeys. 
01043025	Since the brothers had been told that they were going to eat a meal there, they prepared their gift for Joseph’s arrival at noon. 
01043026	When Joseph came home, they presented him with the gifts they had brought, and they bowed to the ground before him. 
01043027	He asked if they were well, and then he asked, “How is your elderly father you told me about? Is he still alive?” 
01043028	“Your servant our father is well,” they answered. “He is still alive.” And they bowed down to honor him. 
01043029	When Joseph looked up and saw his brother Benjamin, his own mother’s son, he asked, “Is this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?” Then he declared, “May God be gracious to you, my son.” 
01043030	Joseph hurried out because he was moved to tears for his brother, and he went to a private room to weep. 
01043031	Then he washed his face and came back out. Regaining his composure, he said, “Serve the meal.” 
01043032	They separately served Joseph, his brothers, and the Egyptians. They ate separately because the Egyptians would not eat with the Hebrews, since that was detestable to them. 
01043033	They were seated before Joseph in order by age, from the firstborn to the youngest, and the men looked at one another in astonishment. 
01043034	When the portions were served to them from Joseph’s table, Benjamin’s portion was five times larger than any of the others. So they feasted and drank freely with Joseph. 
01044001	Then Joseph instructed his steward: “Fill the men’s sacks with as much food as they can carry, and put each one’s silver in the mouth of his sack. 
01044002	Put my cup, the silver one, in the mouth of the youngest one’s sack, along with the silver for his grain.” So the steward did as Joseph had instructed. 
01044003	At daybreak, the men were sent on their way with their donkeys. 
01044004	They had not gone far from the city when Joseph told his steward, “Pursue the men at once, and when you overtake them, ask, ‘Why have you repaid good with evil? 
01044005	Is this not the cup my master drinks from and uses for divination? What you have done is wicked!’” 
01044006	When the steward overtook them, he relayed these words to them. 
01044007	“Why does my lord say these things?” they asked. “Your servants could not possibly do such a thing. 
01044008	We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the silver we found in the mouths of our sacks. Why would we steal silver or gold from your master’s house? 
01044009	If any of your servants is found to have it, he must die, and the rest will become slaves of my lord.” 
01044010	“As you say,” replied the steward. “But only the one who is found with the cup will be my slave, and the rest of you shall be free of blame.” 
01044011	So each one quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it. 
01044012	The steward searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest—and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. 
01044013	Then they all tore their clothes, loaded their donkeys, and returned to the city. 
01044014	When Judah and his brothers arrived at Joseph’s house, he was still there, and they fell to the ground before him. 
01044015	“What is this deed you have done?” Joseph declared. “Do you not know that a man like me can surely divine the truth?” 
01044016	“What can we say to my lord?” Judah replied. “How can we plead? How can we justify ourselves? God has exposed the iniquity of your servants. We are now my lord’s slaves—both we and the one who was found with the cup.” 
01044017	But Joseph replied, “Far be it from me to do this. The man who was found with the cup will be my slave. The rest of you may return to your father in peace.” 
01044018	Then Judah approached Joseph and said, “Sir, please let your servant speak personally to my lord. Do not be angry with your servant, for you are equal to Pharaoh himself. 
01044019	My lord asked his servants, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’ 
01044020	And we answered, ‘We have an elderly father and a younger brother, the child of his old age. The boy’s brother is dead. He is the only one of his mother’s sons left, and his father loves him.’ 
01044021	Then you told your servants, ‘Bring him down to me so that I can see him for myself.’ 
01044022	So we said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father. If he were to leave, his father would die.’ 
01044023	But you said to your servants, ‘Unless your younger brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.’ 
01044024	Now when we returned to your servant my father, we relayed your words to him. 
01044025	Then our father said, ‘Go back and buy us some food.’ 
01044026	But we answered, ‘We cannot go down there unless our younger brother goes with us. So if our younger brother is not with us, we cannot see the man.’ 
01044027	And your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons. 
01044028	When one of them was gone, I said: “Surely he has been torn to pieces.” And I have not seen him since. 
01044029	Now if you also take this one from me and harm comes to him, you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow.’ 
01044030	So if the boy is not with us when I return to your servant, and if my father, whose life is wrapped up in the boy’s life, 
01044031	sees that the boy is not with us, he will die. Then your servants will have brought the gray hair of your servant our father down to Sheol in sorrow. 
01044032	Indeed, your servant guaranteed the boy’s safety to my father, saying, ‘If I do not return him to you, I will bear the guilt before you, my father, all my life.’ 
01044033	Now please let your servant stay here as my lord’s slave in place of the boy. Let him return with his brothers. 
01044034	For how can I go back to my father without the boy? I could not bear to see the misery that would overwhelm him.” 
01045001	Then Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants, and he cried out, “Send everyone away from me!” So none of them were with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers. 
01045002	But he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard him, and Pharaoh’s household soon heard of it. 
01045003	Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?” But they were unable to answer him, because they were terrified in his presence. 
01045004	Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Please come near me.” And they did so. “I am Joseph, your brother,” he said, “the one you sold into Egypt! 
01045005	And now, do not be distressed or angry with yourselves that you sold me into this place, because it was to save lives that God sent me before you. 
01045006	For the famine has covered the land these two years, and there will be five more years without plowing or harvesting. 
01045007	God sent me before you to preserve you as a remnant on the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance. 
01045008	Therefore it was not you who sent me here, but God, who has made me a father to Pharaoh—lord of all his household and ruler over all the land of Egypt. 
01045009	Now return quickly to my father and tell him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says: God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me without delay. 
01045010	You shall settle in the land of Goshen and be near me—you and your children and grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and everything you own. 
01045011	And there I will provide for you, because there will be five more years of famine. Otherwise, you and your household and everything you own will come to destitution.’ 
01045012	Behold! You and my brother Benjamin can see that I, Joseph, am the one speaking with you. 
01045013	Tell my father about all my splendor in Egypt and everything you have seen. And bring my father down here quickly.” 
01045014	Then Joseph threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept as they embraced. 
01045015	Joseph kissed each of his brothers as he wept over them. And afterward his brothers talked with him. 
01045016	When the news reached Pharaoh’s house that Joseph’s brothers had come, Pharaoh and his servants were pleased. 
01045017	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Do as follows: Load your animals and return to the land of Canaan. 
01045018	Then bring your father and your families and return to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat from the fat of the land.’ 
01045019	You are also directed to tell them: ‘Take wagons from the land of Egypt for your young children and your wives, and bring your father and come back. 
01045020	But pay no regard to your belongings, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.’” 
01045021	So the sons of Israel did as they were told. Joseph gave them wagons as Pharaoh had instructed, and he also gave them provisions for their journey. 
01045022	He gave new garments to each of them, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five sets of clothes. 
01045023	And he sent to his father the following: ten donkeys loaded with the best of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provisions for his father’s journey. 
01045024	Then Joseph sent his brothers on their way, and as they were leaving, he said to them, “Do not quarrel on the way!” 
01045025	So the brothers went up out of Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan. 
01045026	“Joseph is still alive,” they said, “and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt!” But Jacob was stunned, for he did not believe them. 
01045027	However, when they relayed all that Joseph had told them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him back, the spirit of their father Jacob was revived. 
01045028	“Enough!” declared Israel. “My son Joseph is still alive! I will go to see him before I die.” 
01046001	So Israel set out with all that he had, and when he came to Beersheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. 
01046002	And that night God spoke to Israel in a vision: “Jacob, Jacob!” He said. “Here I am,” replied Jacob. 
01046003	“I am God,” He said, “the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there. 
01046004	I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will surely bring you back. And Joseph’s own hands will close your eyes.” 
01046005	Then Jacob departed from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel took their father Jacob in the wagons Pharaoh had sent to carry him, along with their children and wives. 
01046006	They also took the livestock and possessions they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and Jacob and all his offspring went to Egypt. 
01046007	Jacob took with him to Egypt his sons and grandsons, and his daughters and granddaughters—all his offspring. 
01046008	Now these are the names of the sons of Israel (Jacob and his descendants) who went to Egypt: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn. 
01046009	The sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. 
01046010	The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. 
01046011	The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
01046012	The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. The sons of Perez: Hezron and Hamul. 
01046013	The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puvah, Job, and Shimron. 
01046014	The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel. 
01046015	These are the sons of Leah born to Jacob in Paddan-aram, in addition to his daughter Dinah. The total number of sons and daughters was thirty-three. 
01046016	The sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli. 
01046017	The children of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and their sister Serah. The sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel. 
01046018	These are the sons of Jacob born to Zilpah—whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah—sixteen in all. 
01046019	The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. 
01046020	Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph in the land of Egypt by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. 
01046021	The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. 
01046022	These are the sons of Rachel born to Jacob—fourteen in all. 
01046023	The son of Dan: Hushim. 
01046024	The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. 
01046025	These are the sons of Jacob born to Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel—seven in all. 
01046026	All those belonging to Jacob who came to Egypt—his direct descendants, besides the wives of Jacob’s sons—numbered sixty-six persons. 
01046027	And with the two sons who had been born to Joseph in Egypt, the members of Jacob’s family who went to Egypt were seventy in all. 
01046028	Now Jacob had sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to get directions to Goshen. When Jacob’s family arrived in the land of Goshen, 
01046029	Joseph prepared his chariot and went there to meet his father Israel. Joseph presented himself to him, embraced him, and wept profusely. 
01046030	Then Israel said to Joseph, “Finally I can die, now that I have seen your face and know that you are still alive!” 
01046031	Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I will go up and inform Pharaoh: ‘My brothers and my father’s household from the land of Canaan have come to me. 
01046032	The men are shepherds; they raise livestock, and they have brought their flocks and herds and all that they own.’ 
01046033	When Pharaoh summons you and asks, ‘What is your occupation?’ 
01046034	you are to say, ‘Your servants have raised livestock ever since our youth—both we and our fathers.’ Then you will be allowed to settle in the land of Goshen, since all shepherds are detestable to the Egyptians.” 
01047001	So Joseph went and told Pharaoh: “My father and my brothers, with their flocks and herds and all they own, have come from the land of Canaan and are now in Goshen.” 
01047002	And he chose five of his brothers and presented them before Pharaoh. 
01047003	“What is your occupation?” Pharaoh asked Joseph’s brothers. “Your servants are shepherds,” they replied, “both we and our fathers.” 
01047004	Then they said to Pharaoh, “We have come to live in the land for a time, because there is no pasture for the flocks of your servants, since the famine in the land of Canaan has been severe. So now, please allow your servants to settle in the land of Goshen.” 
01047005	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Now that your father and brothers have come to you, 
01047006	the land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and brothers in the best part of the land. They may dwell in the land of Goshen. And if you know of any talented men among them, put them in charge of my own livestock.” 
01047007	Then Joseph brought in his father Jacob and presented him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 
01047008	“How many years have you lived?” Pharaoh asked. 
01047009	“My travels have lasted 130 years,” Jacob replied. “My years have been few and hard, and they have not matched the years of the travels of my fathers.” 
01047010	Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh and departed from his presence. 
01047011	So Joseph settled his father and brothers in the land of Egypt and gave them property in the best part of the land, the district of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. 
01047012	Joseph also provided his father and brothers and all his father’s household with food for their families. 
01047013	There was no food, however, in all that region, because the famine was so severe; the lands of Egypt and Canaan had been exhausted by the famine. 
01047014	Joseph collected all the money to be found in the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan in exchange for the grain they were buying, and he brought it into Pharaoh’s palace. 
01047015	When the money from the lands of Egypt and Canaan was gone, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, “Give us food. Why should we die before your eyes? For our funds have run out!” 
01047016	“Then bring me your livestock,” said Joseph. “Since the money is gone, I will sell you food in exchange for your livestock.” 
01047017	So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for their horses, their flocks and herds, and their donkeys. Throughout that year he provided them with food in exchange for all their livestock. 
01047018	When that year was over, they came to him the second year and said, “We cannot hide from our lord that our money is gone and all our livestock belongs to you. There is nothing left for our lord except our bodies and our land. 
01047019	Why should we perish before your eyes—we and our land as well? Purchase us and our land in exchange for food. Then we, along with our land, will be slaves to Pharaoh. Give us seed that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become desolate.” 
01047020	So Joseph acquired for Pharaoh all the land in Egypt; the Egyptians, one and all, sold their fields because the famine was so severe upon them. The land became Pharaoh’s, 
01047021	and Joseph reduced the people to servitude from one end of Egypt to the other. 
01047022	However, he did not acquire the priests’ portion of the land, for it had been given to them by Pharaoh. They ate the rations that Pharaoh supplied; so they did not sell their land. 
01047023	Then Joseph said to the people, “Now that I have acquired you and your land for Pharaoh this day, here is seed for you to sow in the land. 
01047024	At harvest time, you are to give a fifth of it to Pharaoh, and four-fifths will be yours as seed for the field and food for yourselves and your households and children.” 
01047025	“You have saved our lives,” they said. “We have found favor in our lord’s eyes, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.” 
01047026	So Joseph established a law that a fifth of the produce belongs to Pharaoh, and it is in effect in the land of Egypt to this day. Only the priests’ land does not belong to Pharaoh. 
01047027	Now the Israelites settled in the land of Egypt, in the region of Goshen. They acquired property there and became fruitful and increased greatly in number. 
01047028	And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years, and the length of his life was 147 years. 
01047029	When the time drew near for Israel to die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, “If I have found favor in your eyes, put your hand under my thigh and promise to show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt, 
01047030	but when I lie down with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt and bury me with them.” Joseph answered, “I will do as you have requested.” 
01047031	“Swear to me,” Jacob said. So Joseph swore to him, and Israel bowed in worship at the head of his bed. 
01048001	Some time later Joseph was told, “Your father is ill.” So he set out with his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 
01048002	When Jacob was told, “Your son Joseph has come to you,” Israel rallied his strength and sat up in bed. 
01048003	Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and there He blessed me 
01048004	and told me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you; I will make you a multitude of peoples, and will give this land to your descendants after you as an everlasting possession.’ 
01048005	And now your two sons born to you in Egypt before I came to you here shall be reckoned as mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine. 
01048006	Any children born to you after them shall be yours, and they shall be called by the names of their brothers in the territory they inherit. 
01048007	Now as for me, when I was returning from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died along the way in the land of Canaan, some distance from Ephrath. So I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath” (that is, Bethlehem). 
01048008	When Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he asked, “Who are these?” 
01048009	Joseph said to his father, “They are the sons God has given me in this place.” So Jacob said, “Please bring them to me, that I may bless them.” 
01048010	Now Israel’s eyesight was poor because of old age; he could hardly see. Joseph brought his sons to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them. 
01048011	“I never expected to see your face again,” Israel said to Joseph, “but now God has let me see your children as well.” 
01048012	Then Joseph removed his sons from his father’s knees and bowed facedown. 
01048013	And Joseph took both of them—with Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand—and brought them close to him. 
01048014	But Israel stretched out his right hand and put it on the head of Ephraim, the younger; and crossing his hands, he put his left on Manasseh’s head, although Manasseh was the firstborn. 
01048015	Then he blessed Joseph and said: “May the God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day, 
01048016	the angel who has redeemed me from all harm— may He bless these boys. And may they be called by my name and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and may they grow into a multitude upon the earth.” 
01048017	When Joseph saw that his father had placed his right hand on Ephraim’s head, he was displeased and took his father’s hand to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s. 
01048018	“Not so, my father!” Joseph said. “This one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.” 
01048019	But his father refused. “I know, my son, I know!” he said. “He too shall become a people, and he too shall be great; nevertheless, his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his offspring shall become a multitude of nations.” 
01048020	So that day Jacob blessed them and said: “By you shall Israel pronounce this blessing: ‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.’” So he put Ephraim before Manasseh. 
01048021	Then Israel said to Joseph, “Look, I am about to die, but God will be with you and bring you back to the land of your fathers. 
01048022	And to you, as one who is above your brothers, I give the ridge of land that I took from the Amorites with my sword and bow.” 
01049001	Then Jacob called for his sons and said, “Gather around so that I can tell you what will happen to you in the days to come: 
01049002	Come together and listen, O sons of Jacob; listen to your father Israel. 
01049003	Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, excelling in honor, excelling in power. 
01049004	Uncontrolled as the waters, you will no longer excel, because you went up to your father’s bed, onto my couch, and defiled it. 
01049005	Simeon and Levi are brothers; their swords are weapons of violence. 
01049006	May I never enter their council; may I never join their assembly. For they kill men in their anger, and hamstring oxen on a whim. 
01049007	Cursed be their anger, for it is strong, and their wrath, for it is cruel! I will disperse them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel. 
01049008	Judah, your brothers shall praise you. Your hand shall be on the necks of your enemies; your father’s sons shall bow down to you. 
01049009	Judah is a young lion— my son, you return from the prey. Like a lion he crouches and lies down; like a lioness, who dares to rouse him? 
01049010	The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the staff from between his feet, until Shiloh comes and the allegiance of the nations is his. 
01049011	He ties his donkey to the vine, his colt to the choicest branch. He washes his garments in wine, his robes in the blood of grapes. 
01049012	His eyes are darker than wine, and his teeth are whiter than milk. 
01049013	Zebulun shall dwell by the seashore and become a harbor for ships; his border shall extend to Sidon. 
01049014	Issachar is a strong donkey, lying down between the sheepfolds. 
01049015	He saw that his resting place was good and that his land was pleasant, so he bent his shoulder to the burden and submitted to labor as a servant. 
01049016	Dan shall provide justice for his people as one of the tribes of Israel. 
01049017	He will be a snake by the road, a viper in the path that bites the horse’s heels so that its rider tumbles backward. 
01049018	I await Your salvation, O LORD. 
01049019	Gad will be attacked by raiders, but he will attack their heels. 
01049020	Asher’s food will be rich; he shall provide royal delicacies. 
01049021	Naphtali is a doe set free that bears beautiful fawns. 
01049022	Joseph is a fruitful vine— a fruitful vine by a spring, whose branches scale the wall. 
01049023	The archers attacked him with bitterness; they aimed at him in hostility. 
01049024	Yet he steadied his bow, and his strong arms were tempered by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, in the name of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel, 
01049025	by the God of your father who helps you, and by the Almighty who blesses you, with blessings of the heavens above, with blessings of the depths below, with blessings of the breasts and womb. 
01049026	The blessings of your father have surpassed the blessings of the ancient mountains and the bounty of the everlasting hills. May they rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince of his brothers. 
01049027	Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he devours the prey, in the evening he divides the plunder.” 
01049028	These are the tribes of Israel, twelve in all, and this was what their father said to them. He blessed them, and he blessed each one with a suitable blessing. 
01049029	Then Jacob instructed them, “I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite. 
01049030	The cave is in the field of Machpelah near Mamre, in the land of Canaan. This is the field Abraham purchased from Ephron the Hittite as a burial site. 
01049031	There Abraham and his wife Sarah are buried, there Isaac and his wife Rebekah are buried, and there I buried Leah. 
01049032	The field and the cave that is in it were purchased from the Hittites.” 
01049033	When Jacob had finished instructing his sons, he pulled his feet into the bed and breathed his last, and he was gathered to his people. 
01050001	Then Joseph fell upon his father’s face, wept over him, and kissed him. 
01050002	And Joseph directed the physicians in his service to embalm his father Israel. So they embalmed him, 
01050003	taking the forty days required to complete the embalming. And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days. 
01050004	When the days of mourning had passed, Joseph said to Pharaoh’s court, “If I have found favor in your eyes, please tell Pharaoh that 
01050005	my father made me swear an oath when he said, ‘I am about to die. You must bury me in the tomb that I dug for myself in the land of Canaan.’ Now let me go and bury my father, and then return.” 
01050006	Pharaoh replied, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear to do.” 
01050007	Then Joseph went to bury his father, and all the servants of Pharaoh accompanied him—the elders of Pharaoh’s household and all the elders of the land of Egypt— 
01050008	along with all of Joseph’s household, and his brothers, and his father’s household. Only their children and flocks and herds were left in Goshen. 
01050009	Chariots and horsemen alike went up with him, and it was an exceedingly large procession. 
01050010	When they reached the threshing floor of Atad, which is across the Jordan, they lamented and wailed loudly, and Joseph mourned for his father seven days. 
01050011	When the Canaanites of the land saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a solemn ceremony of mourning by the Egyptians.” Thus the place across the Jordan is called Abel-mizraim. 
01050012	So Jacob’s sons did as he had charged them. 
01050013	They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave at Machpelah in the field near Mamre, which Abraham had purchased from Ephron the Hittite as a burial site. 
01050014	After Joseph had buried his father, he returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone with him to bury his father. 
01050015	When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “What if Joseph bears a grudge? Then he will surely repay us for all the evil that we did to him.” 
01050016	So they sent word to Joseph, saying, “Before he died, your father commanded, 
01050017	‘This is what you are to say to Joseph: I beg you, please forgive the transgression and sin of your brothers, for they did you wrong.’ So now, Joseph, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.” When their message came to him, Joseph wept. 
01050018	His brothers also came to him, bowed down before him, and said, “We are your slaves!” 
01050019	But Joseph replied, “Do not be afraid. Am I in the place of God? 
01050020	As for you, what you intended against me for evil, God intended for good, in order to accomplish a day like this—to preserve the lives of many people. 
01050021	Therefore do not be afraid. I will provide for you and your little ones.” So Joseph reassured his brothers and spoke kindly to them. 
01050022	Now Joseph and his father’s household remained in Egypt, and Joseph lived to the age of 110. 
01050023	He saw Ephraim’s sons to the third generation, and indeed the sons of Machir son of Manasseh were brought up on Joseph’s knees. 
01050024	Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but God will surely visit you and bring you up from this land to the land He promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” 
01050025	And Joseph made the sons of Israel take an oath and said, “God will surely attend to you, and then you must carry my bones up from this place.” 
01050026	So Joseph died at the age of 110. And they embalmed his body and placed it in a coffin in Egypt. 
02001001	These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family: 
02001002	Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; 
02001003	Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; 
02001004	Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher. 
02001005	The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy in all, including Joseph, who was already in Egypt. 
02001006	Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died, 
02001007	but the Israelites were fruitful and increased rapidly; they multiplied and became exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them. 
02001008	Then a new king, who did not know Joseph, came to power in Egypt. 
02001009	“Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become too numerous and too powerful for us. 
02001010	Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, or they will increase even more; and if a war breaks out, they may join our enemies, fight against us, and leave the country.” 
02001011	So the Egyptians appointed taskmasters over the Israelites to oppress them with forced labor. As a result, they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. 
02001012	But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and flourished; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites. 
02001013	They worked the Israelites ruthlessly 
02001014	and made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar, and with all kinds of work in the fields. Every service they imposed was harsh. 
02001015	Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah, 
02001016	“When you help the Hebrew women give birth, observe them on the birthstools. If the child is a son, kill him; but if it is a daughter, let her live.” 
02001017	The midwives, however, feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt had instructed; they let the boys live. 
02001018	So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?” 
02001019	The midwives answered Pharaoh, “The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous and give birth before a midwife arrives.” 
02001020	So God was good to the midwives, and the people multiplied and became even more numerous. 
02001021	And because the midwives feared God, He gave them families of their own. 
02001022	Then Pharaoh commanded all his people: “Every son born to the Hebrews you must throw into the Nile, but every daughter you may allow to live.” 
02002001	Now a man of the house of Levi married a Levite woman, 
02002002	and she conceived and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a beautiful child, she hid him for three months. 
02002003	But when she could no longer hide him, she got him a papyrus basket and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in the basket and set it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile. 
02002004	And his sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him. 
02002005	Soon the daughter of Pharaoh went down to bathe in the Nile, and her attendants were walking along the riverbank. And when she saw the basket among the reeds, she sent her maidservant to retrieve it. 
02002006	When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the little boy was crying. So she had compassion on him and said, “This is one of the Hebrew children.” 
02002007	Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and call one of the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?” 
02002008	“Go ahead,” Pharaoh’s daughter told her. And the girl went and called the boy’s mother. 
02002009	Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child and nurse him for me, and I will pay your wages.” So the woman took the boy and nursed him. 
02002010	When the child had grown older, she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses and explained, “I drew him out of the water.” 
02002011	One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to his own people and observed their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people. 
02002012	After looking this way and that and seeing no one, he struck down the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand. 
02002013	The next day Moses went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, “Why are you attacking your companion?” 
02002014	But the man replied, “Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you planning to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid and thought, “This thing I have done has surely become known.” 
02002015	When Pharaoh heard about this matter, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian, where he sat down beside a well. 
02002016	Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father’s flock. 
02002017	And when some shepherds came along and drove them away, Moses rose up to help them and watered their flock. 
02002018	When the daughters returned to their father Reuel, he asked them, “Why have you returned so early today?” 
02002019	“An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds,” they replied. “He even drew water for us and watered the flock.” 
02002020	“So where is he?” their father asked. “Why did you leave the man behind? Invite him to have something to eat.” 
02002021	Moses agreed to stay with the man, and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage. 
02002022	And she gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, saying, “I have become a foreigner in a foreign land.” 
02002023	After a long time, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned and cried out under their burden of slavery, and their cry for deliverance from bondage ascended to God. 
02002024	So God heard their groaning, and He remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
02002025	God saw the Israelites and took notice. 
02003001	Meanwhile, Moses was shepherding the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. He led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. 
02003002	There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a blazing fire from within a bush. Moses saw the bush ablaze with fire, but it was not consumed. 
02003003	So Moses thought, “I must go over and see this marvelous sight. Why is the bush not burning up?” 
02003004	When the LORD saw that he had gone over to look, God called out to him from within the bush, “Moses, Moses!” “Here I am,” he answered. 
02003005	“Do not come any closer,” God said. “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.” 
02003006	Then He said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” At this, Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God. 
02003007	The LORD said, “I have indeed seen the affliction of My people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their oppressors, and I am aware of their sufferings. 
02003008	I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey—the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 
02003009	And now the cry of the Israelites has reached Me, and I have seen how severely the Egyptians are oppressing them. 
02003010	Therefore, go! I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring My people the Israelites out of Egypt.” 
02003011	But Moses asked God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?” 
02003012	“I will surely be with you,” God said, “and this will be the sign to you that I have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, all of you will worship God on this mountain.” 
02003013	Then Moses asked God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is His name?’ What should I tell them?” 
02003014	God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’” 
02003015	God also told Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you.’ This is My name forever, and this is how I am to be remembered in every generation. 
02003016	Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—has appeared to me and said: I have surely attended to you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt. 
02003017	And I have promised to bring you up out of your affliction in Egypt, into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—a land flowing with milk and honey.’ 
02003018	The elders of Israel will listen to what you say, and you must go with them to the king of Egypt and tell him, ‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now please let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness, so that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.’ 
02003019	But I know that the king of Egypt will not allow you to go unless a mighty hand compels him. 
02003020	So I will stretch out My hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders I will perform among them. And after that, he will release you. 
02003021	And I will grant this people such favor in the sight of the Egyptians that when you leave, you will not go away empty-handed. 
02003022	Every woman shall ask her neighbor and any woman staying in her house for silver and gold jewelry and clothing, and you will put them on your sons and daughters. So you will plunder the Egyptians.” 
02004001	Then Moses answered, “What if they do not believe me or listen to my voice? For they may say, ‘The LORD has not appeared to you.’” 
02004002	And the LORD asked him, “What is that in your hand?” “A staff,” he replied. 
02004003	“Throw it on the ground,” said the LORD. So Moses threw it on the ground, and it became a snake, and he ran from it. 
02004004	“Stretch out your hand and grab it by the tail,” the LORD said to Moses, who reached out his hand and caught the snake, and it turned back into a staff in his hand. 
02004005	“This is so that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—has appeared to you.” 
02004006	Furthermore, the LORD said to Moses, “Put your hand inside your cloak.” So he put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, his hand was leprous, white as snow. 
02004007	“Put your hand back inside your cloak,” said the LORD. So Moses put his hand back inside his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his skin. 
02004008	And the LORD said, “If they refuse to believe you or heed the witness of the first sign, they may believe that of the second. 
02004009	But if they do not believe even these two signs or listen to your voice, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. Then the water you take from the Nile will become blood on the ground.” 
02004010	“Please, Lord,” Moses replied, “I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since You have spoken to Your servant, for I am slow of speech and tongue.” 
02004011	And the LORD said to him, “Who gave man his mouth? Or who makes the mute or the deaf, the sighted or the blind? Is it not I, the LORD? 
02004012	Now go! I will help you as you speak, and I will teach you what to say.” 
02004013	But Moses replied, “Please, Lord, send someone else.” 
02004014	Then the anger of the LORD burned against Moses, and He said, “Is not Aaron the Levite your brother? I know that he can speak well, and he is now on his way to meet you. When he sees you, he will be glad in his heart. 
02004015	You are to speak to him and put the words in his mouth. I will help both of you to speak, and I will teach you what to do. 
02004016	He will speak to the people for you. He will be your spokesman, and it will be as if you were God to him. 
02004017	But take this staff in your hand so you can perform signs with it.” 
02004018	Then Moses went back to his father-in-law Jethro and said to him, “Please let me return to my brothers in Egypt to see if they are still alive.” “Go in peace,” Jethro replied. 
02004019	Now the LORD had said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, for all the men who sought to kill you are dead.” 
02004020	So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey, and headed back to Egypt. And he took the staff of God in his hand. 
02004021	The LORD instructed Moses, “When you go back to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders that I have put within your power. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go. 
02004022	Then tell Pharaoh that this is what the LORD says: ‘Israel is My firstborn son, 
02004023	and I told you to let My son go so that he may worship Me. But since you have refused to let him go, behold, I will kill your firstborn son!’” 
02004024	Now at a lodging place along the way, the LORD met Moses and was about to kill him. 
02004025	But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son’s foreskin, and touched it to Moses’ feet. “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me,” she said. 
02004026	So the LORD let him alone. (When she said, “bridegroom of blood,” she was referring to the circumcision.) 
02004027	Meanwhile, the LORD had said to Aaron, “Go and meet Moses in the wilderness.” So he went and met Moses at the mountain of God and kissed him. 
02004028	And Moses told Aaron everything the LORD had sent him to say, and all the signs He had commanded him to perform. 
02004029	Then Moses and Aaron went and assembled all the elders of the Israelites, 
02004030	and Aaron relayed everything the LORD had said to Moses. And Moses performed the signs before the people, 
02004031	and they believed. And when they heard that the LORD had attended to the Israelites and had seen their affliction, they bowed down and worshiped. 
02005001	After that, Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Let My people go, so that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness.’” 
02005002	But Pharaoh replied, “Who is the LORD that I should obey His voice and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD, and I will not let Israel go.” 
02005003	“The God of the Hebrews has met with us,” they answered. “Please let us go on a three-day journey into the wilderness to sacrifice to the LORD our God, or He may strike us with plagues or with the sword.” 
02005004	But the king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why do you draw the people away from their work? Get back to your labor!” 
02005005	Pharaoh also said, “Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you would be stopping them from their labor.” 
02005006	That same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their foremen: 
02005007	“You shall no longer supply the people with straw for making bricks. They must go and gather their own straw. 
02005008	But require of them the same quota of bricks as before; do not reduce it. For they are lazy; that is why they are crying out, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’ 
02005009	Make the work harder on the men so they will be occupied and pay no attention to these lies.” 
02005010	So the taskmasters and foremen of the people went out and said to them, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I am no longer giving you straw. 
02005011	Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it; but your workload will in no way be reduced.’” 
02005012	So the people scattered all over the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. 
02005013	The taskmasters kept pressing them, saying, “Fulfill your quota each day, just as you did when straw was provided.” 
02005014	Then the Israelite foremen, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over the people, were beaten and asked, “Why have you not fulfilled your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as you did before?” 
02005015	So the Israelite foremen went and appealed to Pharaoh: “Why are you treating your servants this way? 
02005016	No straw has been given to your servants, yet we are told, ‘Make bricks!’ Look, your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people.” 
02005017	“You are slackers!” Pharaoh replied. “Slackers! That is why you keep saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.’ 
02005018	Now get to work. You will be given no straw, yet you must deliver the full quota of bricks.” 
02005019	The Israelite foremen realized they were in trouble when they were told, “You must not reduce your daily quota of bricks.” 
02005020	When they left Pharaoh, they confronted Moses and Aaron, who stood waiting to meet them. 
02005021	“May the LORD look upon you and judge you,” the foremen said, “for you have made us a stench before Pharaoh and his officials; you have placed in their hand a sword to kill us!” 
02005022	So Moses returned to the LORD and asked, “Lord, why have You brought trouble upon this people? Is this why You sent me? 
02005023	Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has brought trouble on this people, and You have not delivered Your people in any way.” 
02006001	But the LORD said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh, for because of My mighty hand he will let the people go; because of My strong hand he will drive them out of his land.” 
02006002	God also told Moses, “I am the LORD. 
02006003	I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by My name the LORD I did not make Myself known to them. 
02006004	I also established My covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land where they lived as foreigners. 
02006005	Furthermore, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered My covenant. 
02006006	Therefore tell the Israelites: ‘I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians and deliver you from their bondage. I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment. 
02006007	I will take you as My own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. 
02006008	And I will bring you into the land that I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the LORD!’” 
02006009	Moses relayed this message to the Israelites, but on account of their broken spirit and cruel bondage, they did not listen to him. 
02006010	So the LORD said to Moses, 
02006011	“Go and tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his land.” 
02006012	But in the LORD’s presence Moses replied, “If the Israelites will not listen to me, then why would Pharaoh listen to me, since I am unskilled in speech?” 
02006013	Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron and gave them a charge concerning both the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt. 
02006014	These were the heads of their fathers’ houses: The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, were Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. These were the clans of Reuben. 
02006015	The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the clans of Simeon. 
02006016	These were the names of the sons of Levi according to their records: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Levi lived 137 years. 
02006017	The sons of Gershon were Libni and Shimei, by their clans. 
02006018	The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years. 
02006019	The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These were the clans of the Levites according to their records. 
02006020	And Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed, and she bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years. 
02006021	The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri. 
02006022	The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri. 
02006023	And Aaron married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 
02006024	The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These were the clans of the Korahites. 
02006025	Aaron’s son Eleazar married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These were the heads of the Levite families by their clans. 
02006026	It was this Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, “Bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt by their divisions.” 
02006027	Moses and Aaron were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt in order to bring the Israelites out of Egypt. 
02006028	Now on the day that the LORD spoke to Moses in Egypt, 
02006029	He said to him, “I am the LORD; tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I say to you.” 
02006030	But in the LORD’s presence Moses replied, “Since I am unskilled in speech, why would Pharaoh listen to me?” 
02007001	The LORD answered Moses, “See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet. 
02007002	You are to speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron is to tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his land. 
02007003	But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and though I will multiply My signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, 
02007004	Pharaoh will not listen to you. Then I will lay My hand on Egypt, and by mighty acts of judgment I will bring the divisions of My people the Israelites out of the land of Egypt. 
02007005	And the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD, when I stretch out My hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out from among them.” 
02007006	So Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD had commanded them. 
02007007	Moses was eighty years old and Aaron was eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh. 
02007008	The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 
02007009	“When Pharaoh tells you, ‘Perform a miracle,’ you are to say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh,’ and it will become a serpent.” 
02007010	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the LORD had commanded. Aaron threw his staff down before Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a serpent. 
02007011	But Pharaoh called the wise men and sorcerers and magicians of Egypt, and they also did the same things by their magic arts. 
02007012	Each one threw down his staff, and it became a serpent. But Aaron’s staff swallowed up the other staffs. 
02007013	Still, Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, just as the LORD had said. 
02007014	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is unyielding; he refuses to let the people go. 
02007015	Go to Pharaoh in the morning as you see him walking out to the water. Wait on the bank of the Nile to meet him, and take in your hand the staff that was changed into a snake. 
02007016	Then say to him, ‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to tell you: Let My people go, so that they may worship Me in the wilderness. But until now you have not listened. 
02007017	This is what the LORD says: By this you will know that I am the LORD. Behold, with the staff in my hand I will strike the water of the Nile, and it will turn to blood. 
02007018	The fish in the Nile will die, the river will stink, and the Egyptians will be unable to drink its water.’” 
02007019	And the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt—over their rivers and canals and ponds and all the reservoirs—that they may become blood.’ There will be blood throughout the land of Egypt, even in the vessels of wood and stone.” 
02007020	Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD had commanded; in the presence of Pharaoh and his officials, Aaron raised the staff and struck the water of the Nile, and all the water was turned to blood. 
02007021	The fish in the Nile died, and the river smelled so bad that the Egyptians could not drink its water. And there was blood throughout the land of Egypt. 
02007022	But the magicians of Egypt did the same things by their magic arts. So Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said. 
02007023	Instead, Pharaoh turned around, went into his palace, and did not take any of this to heart. 
02007024	So all the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water to drink, because they could not drink the water from the river. 
02007025	And seven full days passed after the LORD had struck the Nile. 
02008001	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and tell him that this is what the LORD says: ‘Let My people go, so that they may worship Me. 
02008002	But if you refuse to let them go, I will plague your whole country with frogs. 
02008003	The Nile will teem with frogs, and they will come into your palace and up to your bedroom and onto your bed, into the houses of your officials and your people, and into your ovens and kneading bowls. 
02008004	The frogs will come up on you and your people and all your officials.’” 
02008005	And the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers and canals and ponds, and cause the frogs to come up onto the land of Egypt.’” 
02008006	So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt. 
02008007	But the magicians did the same thing by their magic arts, and they also brought frogs up onto the land of Egypt. 
02008008	Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to the LORD to take the frogs away from me and my people. Then I will let your people go, that they may sacrifice to the LORD.” 
02008009	Moses said to Pharaoh, “You may have the honor over me. When shall I pray for you and your officials and your people that the frogs (except for those in the Nile) may be taken away from you and your houses?” 
02008010	“Tomorrow,” Pharaoh answered. “May it be as you say,” Moses replied, “so that you may know that there is no one like the LORD our God. 
02008011	The frogs will depart from you and your houses and your officials and your people; they will remain only in the Nile.” 
02008012	After Moses and Aaron had left Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the LORD for help with the frogs that He had brought against Pharaoh. 
02008013	And the LORD did as Moses requested, and the frogs in the houses, the courtyards, and the fields died. 
02008014	They were piled into countless heaps, and there was a terrible stench in the land. 
02008015	When Pharaoh saw that there was relief, however, he hardened his heart and would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said. 
02008016	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, that it may turn into swarms of gnats throughout the land of Egypt.’” 
02008017	This they did, and when Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, gnats came upon man and beast. All the dust of the earth turned into gnats throughout the land of Egypt. 
02008018	The magicians tried to produce gnats using their magic arts, but they could not. And the gnats remained on man and beast. 
02008019	“This is the finger of God,” the magicians said to Pharaoh. But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, just as the LORD had said. 
02008020	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning, and when Pharaoh goes out to the water, stand before him and tell him that this is what the LORD says: ‘Let My people go, so that they may worship Me. 
02008021	But if you will not let My people go, I will send swarms of flies upon you and your officials and your people and your houses. The houses of the Egyptians and even the ground where they stand will be full of flies. 
02008022	But on that day I will give special treatment to the land of Goshen, where My people live; no swarms of flies will be found there. In this way you will know that I, the LORD, am in the land. 
02008023	I will make a distinction between My people and your people. This sign will take place tomorrow.’” 
02008024	And the LORD did so. Thick swarms of flies poured into Pharaoh’s palace and into the houses of his officials. Throughout Egypt the land was ruined by swarms of flies. 
02008025	Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God within this land.” 
02008026	But Moses replied, “It would not be right to do that, because the sacrifices we offer to the LORD our God would be detestable to the Egyptians. If we offer sacrifices that are detestable before the Egyptians, will they not stone us? 
02008027	We must make a three-day journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God as He commands us.” 
02008028	Pharaoh answered, “I will let you go and sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness, but you must not go very far. Now pray for me.” 
02008029	“As soon as I leave you,” Moses said, “I will pray to the LORD, so that tomorrow the swarms of flies will depart from Pharaoh and his officials and his people. But Pharaoh must not act deceitfully again by refusing to let the people go and sacrifice to the LORD.” 
02008030	Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD, 
02008031	and the LORD did as Moses requested. He removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh and his officials and his people; not one fly remained. 
02008032	But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time as well, and he would not let the people go. 
02009001	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and tell him that this is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: ‘Let My people go, so that they may worship Me. 
02009002	But if you continue to restrain them and refuse to let them go, 
02009003	then the hand of the LORD will bring a severe plague on your livestock in the field—on your horses, donkeys, camels, herds, and flocks. 
02009004	But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, so that no animal belonging to the Israelites will die.’” 
02009005	The LORD set a time, saying, “Tomorrow the LORD will do this in the land.” 
02009006	And the next day the LORD did just that. All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one animal belonging to the Israelites died. 
02009007	Pharaoh sent officials and found that none of the livestock of the Israelites had died. But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he would not let the people go. 
02009008	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Take handfuls of soot from the furnace; in the sight of Pharaoh, Moses is to toss it into the air. 
02009009	It will become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and festering boils will break out on man and beast throughout the land.” 
02009010	So they took soot from the furnace and stood before Pharaoh. Moses tossed it into the air, and festering boils broke out on man and beast. 
02009011	The magicians could not stand before Moses, because the boils had broken out on them and on all the Egyptians. 
02009012	But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not listen to them, just as the LORD had said to Moses. 
02009013	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning, stand before Pharaoh, and tell him that this is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: ‘Let My people go, so that they may worship Me. 
02009014	Otherwise, I will send all My plagues against you and your officials and your people, so you may know that there is no one like Me in all the earth. 
02009015	For by this time I could have stretched out My hand and struck you and your people with a plague to wipe you off the earth. 
02009016	But I have raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display My power to you, and that My name might be proclaimed in all the earth. 
02009017	Still, you lord it over My people and do not allow them to go. 
02009018	Behold, at this time tomorrow I will rain down the worst hail that has ever fallen on Egypt, from the day it was founded until now. 
02009019	So give orders now to shelter your livestock and everything you have in the field. Every man or beast that remains in the field and is not brought inside will die when the hail comes down upon them.’” 
02009020	Those among Pharaoh’s officials who feared the word of the LORD hurried to bring their servants and livestock to shelter, 
02009021	but those who disregarded the word of the LORD left their servants and livestock in the field. 
02009022	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward heaven, so that hail may fall on all the land of Egypt—on man and beast and every plant of the field throughout the land of Egypt.” 
02009023	So Moses stretched out his staff toward heaven, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and lightning struck the earth. So the LORD rained down hail upon the land of Egypt. 
02009024	The hail fell and the lightning continued flashing through it. The hail was so severe that nothing like it had ever been seen in all the land of Egypt from the time it became a nation. 
02009025	Throughout the land of Egypt, the hail struck down everything in the field, both man and beast; it beat down every plant of the field and stripped every tree. 
02009026	The only place where it did not hail was in the land of Goshen, where the Israelites lived. 
02009027	Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron. “This time I have sinned,” he said. “The LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked. 
02009028	Pray to the LORD, for there has been enough of God’s thunder and hail. I will let you go; you do not need to stay any longer.” 
02009029	Moses said to him, “When I have left the city, I will spread out my hands to the LORD. The thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, so that you may know that the earth is the LORD’s. 
02009030	But as for you and your officials, I know that you still do not fear the LORD our God.” 
02009031	(Now the flax and barley were destroyed, since the barley was ripe and the flax was in bloom; 
02009032	but the wheat and spelt were not destroyed, because they are late crops.) 
02009033	Then Moses departed from Pharaoh, went out of the city, and spread out his hands to the LORD. The thunder and hail ceased, and the rain no longer poured down on the land. 
02009034	When Pharaoh saw that the rain and hail and thunder had ceased, he sinned again and hardened his heart—he and his officials. 
02009035	So Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the LORD had said through Moses. 
02010001	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials, that I may perform these miraculous signs of Mine among them, 
02010002	and that you may tell your children and grandchildren how severely I dealt with the Egyptians when I performed miraculous signs among them, so that all of you may know that I am the LORD.” 
02010003	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and told him, “This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: ‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go, so that they may worship Me. 
02010004	But if you refuse to let My people go, I will bring locusts into your territory tomorrow. 
02010005	They will cover the face of the land so that no one can see it. They will devour whatever is left after the hail and eat every tree that grows in your fields. 
02010006	They will fill your houses and the houses of all your officials and every Egyptian—something neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen since the day they came into this land.’” Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh’s presence. 
02010007	Pharaoh’s officials asked him, “How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the LORD their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt lies in ruins?” 
02010008	So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. “Go, worship the LORD your God,” he said. “But who exactly will be going?” 
02010009	“We will go with our young and old,” Moses replied. “We will go with our sons and daughters, and with our flocks and herds, for we must hold a feast to the LORD.” 
02010010	Then Pharaoh told them, “May the LORD be with you if I ever let you go with your little ones. Clearly you are bent on evil. 
02010011	No, only the men may go and worship the LORD, since that is what you have been requesting.” And Moses and Aaron were driven from Pharaoh’s presence. 
02010012	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt, so that the locusts may swarm over it and devour every plant in the land—everything that the hail has left behind.” 
02010013	So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and throughout that day and night the LORD sent an east wind across the land. By morning the east wind had brought the locusts. 
02010014	The locusts swarmed across the land and settled over the entire territory of Egypt. Never before had there been so many locusts, and never again will there be. 
02010015	They covered the face of all the land until it was black, and they consumed all the plants on the ground and all the fruit on the trees that the hail had left behind. Nothing green was left on any tree or plant in all the land of Egypt. 
02010016	Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you. 
02010017	Now please forgive my sin once more and appeal to the LORD your God, that He may remove this death from me.” 
02010018	So Moses left Pharaoh’s presence and appealed to the LORD. 
02010019	And the LORD changed the wind to a very strong west wind that carried off the locusts and blew them into the Red Sea. Not a single locust remained anywhere in Egypt. 
02010020	But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let the Israelites go. 
02010021	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward heaven, so that darkness may spread over the land of Egypt—a palpable darkness.” 
02010022	So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and total darkness covered all the land of Egypt for three days. 
02010023	No one could see anyone else, and for three days no one left his place. Yet all the Israelites had light in their dwellings. 
02010024	Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, “Go, worship the LORD. Even your little ones may go with you; only your flocks and herds must stay behind.” 
02010025	But Moses replied, “You must also provide us with sacrifices and burnt offerings to present to the LORD our God. 
02010026	Even our livestock must go with us; not a hoof will be left behind, for we will need some of them to worship the LORD our God, and we will not know how we are to worship the LORD until we arrive.” 
02010027	But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was unwilling to let them go. 
02010028	“Depart from me!” Pharaoh said to Moses. “Make sure you never see my face again, for on the day you see my face, you will die.” 
02010029	“As you say,” Moses replied, “I will never see your face again.” 
02011001	Then the LORD said to Moses, “I will bring upon Pharaoh and Egypt one more plague. After that, he will allow you to leave this place. And when he lets you go, he will drive you out completely. 
02011002	Now announce to the people that men and women alike should ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold.” 
02011003	And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover, Moses himself was highly regarded in Egypt by Pharaoh’s officials and by the people. 
02011004	So Moses declared, “This is what the LORD says: ‘About midnight I will go throughout Egypt, 
02011005	and every firstborn son in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, to the firstborn of the servant girl behind the hand mill, as well as the firstborn of all the cattle. 
02011006	Then a great cry will go out over all the land of Egypt. Such an outcry has never been heard before and will never be heard again. 
02011007	But among all the Israelites, not even a dog will snarl at man or beast.’ Then you will know that the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel. 
02011008	And all these officials of yours will come and bow before me, saying, ‘Go, you and all the people who follow you!’ After that, I will depart.” And hot with anger, Moses left Pharaoh’s presence. 
02011009	The LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.” 
02011010	Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart so that he would not let the Israelites go out of his land. 
02012001	Now the LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, 
02012002	“This month is the beginning of months for you; it shall be the first month of your year. 
02012003	Tell the whole congregation of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man must select a lamb for his family, one per household. 
02012004	If the household is too small for a whole lamb, they are to share with the nearest neighbor based on the number of people, and apportion the lamb accordingly. 
02012005	Your lamb must be an unblemished year-old male, and you may take it from the sheep or the goats. 
02012006	You must keep it until the fourteenth day of the month, when the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel will slaughter the animals at twilight. 
02012007	They are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs. 
02012008	They are to eat the meat that night, roasted over the fire, along with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. 
02012009	Do not eat any of the meat raw or cooked in boiling water, but only roasted over the fire—its head and legs and inner parts. 
02012010	Do not leave any of it until morning; before the morning you must burn up any part that is left over. 
02012011	This is how you are to eat it: You must be fully dressed for travel, with your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. You are to eat in haste; it is the LORD’s Passover. 
02012012	On that night I will pass through the land of Egypt and strike down every firstborn male, both man and beast, and I will execute judgment against all the gods of Egypt. I am the LORD. 
02012013	The blood on the houses where you are staying will be a sign; when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No plague will fall on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt. 
02012014	And this day will be a memorial for you, and you are to celebrate it as a feast to the LORD, as a permanent statute for the generations to come. 
02012015	For seven days you must eat unleavened bread. On the first day you are to remove the leaven from your houses. Whoever eats anything leavened from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel. 
02012016	On the first day you are to hold a sacred assembly, and another on the seventh day. You must not do any work on those days, except to prepare the meals—that is all you may do. 
02012017	So you are to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on this very day I brought your divisions out of the land of Egypt. You must keep this day as a permanent statute for the generations to come. 
02012018	In the first month you are to eat unleavened bread, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day. 
02012019	For seven days there must be no leaven found in your houses. If anyone eats something leavened, that person, whether a foreigner or native of the land, must be cut off from the congregation of Israel. 
02012020	You are not to eat anything leavened; eat unleavened bread in all your homes.” 
02012021	Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and told them, “Go at once and select for yourselves a lamb for each family, and slaughter the Passover lamb. 
02012022	Take a cluster of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin, and brush the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe. None of you shall go out the door of his house until morning. 
02012023	When the LORD passes through to strike down the Egyptians, He will see the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe and will pass over that doorway; so He will not allow the destroyer to enter your houses and strike you down. 
02012024	And you are to keep this command as a permanent statute for you and your descendants. 
02012025	When you enter the land that the LORD will give you as He promised, you are to keep this service. 
02012026	When your children ask you, ‘What does this service mean to you?’ 
02012027	you are to reply, ‘It is the Passover sacrifice to the LORD, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when He struck down the Egyptians and spared our homes.’” Then the people bowed down and worshiped. 
02012028	And the Israelites went and did just what the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron. 
02012029	Now at midnight the LORD struck down every firstborn male in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on his throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner in the dungeon, as well as all the firstborn among the livestock. 
02012030	During the night Pharaoh got up—he and all his officials and all the Egyptians—and there was loud wailing in Egypt; for there was no house without someone dead. 
02012031	Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron by night and said, “Get up, leave my people, both you and the Israelites! Go, worship the LORD as you have requested. 
02012032	Take your flocks and herds as well, just as you have said, and depart! And bless me also.” 
02012033	And in order to send them out of the land quickly, the Egyptians urged the people on. “For otherwise,” they said, “we are all going to die!” 
02012034	So the people took their dough before it was leavened, carrying it on their shoulders in kneading bowls wrapped in clothing. 
02012035	Furthermore, the Israelites acted on Moses’ word and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold, and for clothing. 
02012036	And the LORD gave the people such favor in the sight of the Egyptians that they granted their request. In this way they plundered the Egyptians. 
02012037	The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth with about 600,000 men on foot, besides women and children. 
02012038	And a mixed multitude also went up with them, along with great droves of livestock, both flocks and herds. 
02012039	Since their dough had no leaven, the people baked what they had brought out of Egypt into unleavened loaves. For when they had been driven out of Egypt, they could not delay and had not prepared any provisions for themselves. 
02012040	Now the duration of the Israelites’ stay in Egypt was 430 years. 
02012041	At the end of the 430 years, to the very day, all the LORD’s divisions went out of the land of Egypt. 
02012042	Because the LORD kept a vigil that night to bring them out of the land of Egypt, this same night is to be a vigil to the LORD, to be observed by all the Israelites for the generations to come. 
02012043	And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the statute of the Passover: No foreigner is to eat of it. 
02012044	But any slave who has been purchased may eat of it, after you have circumcised him. 
02012045	A temporary resident or hired hand shall not eat the Passover. 
02012046	It must be eaten inside one house. You are not to take any of the meat outside the house, and you may not break any of the bones. 
02012047	The whole congregation of Israel must celebrate it. 
02012048	If a foreigner resides with you and wants to celebrate the LORD’s Passover, all the males in the household must be circumcised; then he may come near to celebrate it, and he shall be like a native of the land. But no uncircumcised man may eat of it. 
02012049	The same law shall apply to both the native and the foreigner who resides among you.” 
02012050	Then all the Israelites did this—they did just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron. 
02012051	And on that very day the LORD brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt by their divisions. 
02013001	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
02013002	“Consecrate to Me every firstborn male. The firstborn from every womb among the Israelites belongs to Me, both of man and beast.” 
02013003	So Moses told the people, “Remember this day, the day you came out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; for the LORD brought you out of it by the strength of His hand. And nothing leavened shall be eaten. 
02013004	Today, in the month of Abib, you are leaving. 
02013005	And when the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites—the land He swore to your fathers that He would give you, a land flowing with milk and honey—you shall keep this service in this month. 
02013006	For seven days you are to eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the LORD. 
02013007	Unleavened bread shall be eaten during those seven days. Nothing leavened may be found among you, nor shall leaven be found anywhere within your borders. 
02013008	And on that day you are to explain to your son, ‘This is because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.’ 
02013009	It shall be a sign for you on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that the Law of the LORD is to be on your lips. For with a mighty hand the LORD brought you out of Egypt. 
02013010	Therefore you shall keep this statute at the appointed time year after year. 
02013011	And after the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you, as He swore to you and your fathers, 
02013012	you are to present to the LORD the firstborn male of every womb. All the firstborn males of your livestock belong to the LORD. 
02013013	You must redeem every firstborn donkey with a lamb, and if you do not redeem it, you are to break its neck. And every firstborn of your sons you must redeem. 
02013014	In the future, when your son asks you, ‘What does this mean?’ you are to tell him, ‘With a mighty hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. 
02013015	And when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both of man and beast. This is why I sacrifice to the LORD the firstborn male of every womb, but I redeem all the firstborn of my sons.’ 
02013016	So it shall serve as a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead, for with a mighty hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt.” 
02013017	When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them along the road through the land of the Philistines, though it was shorter. For God said, “If the people face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.” 
02013018	So God led the people around by the way of the wilderness toward the Red Sea. And the Israelites left the land of Egypt arrayed for battle. 
02013019	Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the sons of Israel swear a solemn oath when he said, “God will surely attend to you, and then you must carry my bones with you from this place.” 
02013020	They set out from Succoth and camped at Etham on the edge of the wilderness. 
02013021	And the LORD went before them in a pillar of cloud to guide their way by day, and in a pillar of fire to give them light by night, so that they could travel by day or night. 
02013022	Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place before the people. 
02014001	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
02014002	“Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. You are to encamp by the sea, directly opposite Baal-zephon. 
02014003	For Pharaoh will say of the Israelites, ‘They are wandering the land in confusion; the wilderness has boxed them in.’ 
02014004	And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart so that he will pursue them. But I will gain honor by means of Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD.” So this is what the Israelites did. 
02014005	When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said, “What have we done? We have released Israel from serving us.” 
02014006	So Pharaoh prepared his chariot and took his army with him. 
02014007	He took 600 of the best chariots, and all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all of them. 
02014008	And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out defiantly. 
02014009	The Egyptians—all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots, horsemen and troops—pursued the Israelites and overtook them as they camped by the sea near Pi-hahiroth, opposite Baal-zephon. 
02014010	As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up and saw the Egyptians marching after them, and they were terrified and cried out to the LORD. 
02014011	They said to Moses, “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us into the wilderness to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt? 
02014012	Did we not say to you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone so that we may serve the Egyptians’? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.” 
02014013	But Moses told the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the LORD’s salvation, which He will accomplish for you today; for the Egyptians you see today, you will never see again. 
02014014	The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still.” 
02014015	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Why are you crying out to Me? Tell the Israelites to go forward. 
02014016	And as for you, lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground. 
02014017	And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them. Then I will gain honor by means of Pharaoh and all his army and chariots and horsemen. 
02014018	The Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I am honored through Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.” 
02014019	And the angel of God, who had gone before the camp of Israel, withdrew and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from before them and stood behind them, 
02014020	so that it came between the camps of Egypt and Israel. The cloud was there in the darkness, but it lit up the night. So all night long neither camp went near the other. 
02014021	Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the LORD drove back the sea with a strong east wind that turned it into dry land. So the waters were divided, 
02014022	and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with walls of water on their right and on their left. 
02014023	And the Egyptians chased after them—all Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and horsemen—and followed them into the sea. 
02014024	At morning watch, however, the LORD looked down on the army of the Egyptians from the pillar of fire and cloud, and He threw their camp into confusion. 
02014025	He caused their chariot wheels to wobble, so that they had difficulty driving. “Let us flee from the Israelites,” said the Egyptians, “for the LORD is fighting for them against Egypt!” 
02014026	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, so that the waters may flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen.” 
02014027	So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea returned to its normal state. As the Egyptians were retreating, the LORD swept them into the sea. 
02014028	The waters flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen—the entire army of Pharaoh that had chased the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived. 
02014029	But the Israelites had walked through the sea on dry ground, with walls of water on their right and on their left. 
02014030	That day the LORD saved Israel from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the shore. 
02014031	When Israel saw the great power that the LORD had exercised over the Egyptians, the people feared the LORD and believed in Him and in His servant Moses. 
02015001	Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD: “I will sing to the LORD, for He is highly exalted. The horse and rider He has thrown into the sea. 
02015002	The LORD is my strength and my song, and He has become my salvation. He is my God, and I will praise Him, my father’s God, and I will exalt Him. 
02015003	The LORD is a warrior, the LORD is His name. 
02015004	Pharaoh’s chariots and army He has cast into the sea; the finest of his officers are drowned in the Red Sea. 
02015005	The depths have covered them; they sank there like a stone. 
02015006	Your right hand, O LORD, is majestic in power; Your right hand, O LORD, has shattered the enemy. 
02015007	You overthrew Your adversaries by Your great majesty. You unleashed Your burning wrath; it consumed them like stubble. 
02015008	At the blast of Your nostrils the waters piled up; like a wall the currents stood firm; the depths congealed in the heart of the sea. 
02015009	The enemy declared, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake. I will divide the spoils; I will gorge myself on them. I will draw my sword; my hand will destroy them.’ 
02015010	But You blew with Your breath, and the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters. 
02015011	Who among the gods is like You, O LORD? Who is like You—majestic in holiness, revered with praises, performing wonders? 
02015012	You stretched out Your right hand, and the earth swallowed them up. 
02015013	With loving devotion You will lead the people You have redeemed; with Your strength You will guide them to Your holy dwelling. 
02015014	The nations will hear and tremble; anguish will grip the dwellers of Philistia. 
02015015	Then the chiefs of Edom will be dismayed; trembling will seize the leaders of Moab; those who dwell in Canaan will melt away, 
02015016	and terror and dread will fall on them. By the power of Your arm they will be as still as a stone until Your people pass by, O LORD, until the people You have bought pass by. 
02015017	You will bring them in and plant them on the mountain of Your inheritance— the place, O LORD, You have prepared for Your dwelling, the sanctuary, O Lord, Your hands have established. 
02015018	The LORD will reign forever and ever!” 
02015019	For when Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and horsemen went into the sea, the LORD brought the waters of the sea back over them. But the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground. 
02015020	Then Miriam the prophetess, Aaron’s sister, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women followed her with tambourines and dancing. 
02015021	And Miriam sang back to them: “Sing to the LORD, for He is highly exalted; the horse and rider He has thrown into the sea.” 
02015022	Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the Desert of Shur. For three days they walked in the desert without finding water. 
02015023	And when they came to Marah, they could not drink the water there because it was bitter. (That is why it was named Marah.) 
02015024	So the people grumbled against Moses, saying, “What are we to drink?” 
02015025	And Moses cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a log. And when he cast it into the waters, they were sweetened. There the LORD made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there He tested them, 
02015026	saying, “If you will listen carefully to the voice of the LORD your God, and do what is right in His eyes, and pay attention to His commands, and keep all His statutes, then I will not bring on you any of the diseases I inflicted on the Egyptians. For I am the LORD who heals you.” 
02015027	Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, and they camped there by the waters. 
02016001	On the fifteenth day of the second month after they had left the land of Egypt, the whole congregation of Israel set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai. 
02016002	And there in the desert the whole congregation of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron. 
02016003	“If only we had died by the LORD’s hand in the land of Egypt!” they said. “There we sat by pots of meat and ate our fill of bread, but you have brought us into this desert to starve this whole assembly to death!” 
02016004	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I will rain down bread from heaven for you. Each day the people are to go out and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test whether or not they will follow My instructions. 
02016005	Then on the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather on the other days.” 
02016006	So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “This evening you will know that it was the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt, 
02016007	and in the morning you will see the LORD’s glory, because He has heard your grumbling against Him. For who are we, that you should grumble against us?” 
02016008	And Moses added, “The LORD will give you meat to eat this evening and bread to fill you in the morning, for He has heard your grumbling against Him. Who are we? Your grumblings are not against us but against the LORD.” 
02016009	Then Moses said to Aaron, “Tell the whole congregation of Israel, ‘Come before the LORD, for He has heard your grumbling.’” 
02016010	And as Aaron was speaking to the whole congregation of Israel, they looked toward the desert, and there in a cloud the glory of the LORD appeared. 
02016011	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
02016012	“I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God.’” 
02016013	That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp. 
02016014	When the layer of dew had evaporated, there were thin flakes on the desert floor, as fine as frost on the ground. 
02016015	When the Israelites saw it, they asked one another, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was. So Moses told them, “It is the bread that the LORD has given you to eat. 
02016016	This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Each one is to gather as much as he needs. You may take an omer for each person in your tent.’” 
02016017	So the Israelites did this. Some gathered more, and some less. 
02016018	When they measured it by the omer, he who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no shortfall. Each one gathered as much as he needed to eat. 
02016019	Then Moses said to them, “No one may keep any of it until morning.” 
02016020	But they did not listen to Moses; some people left part of it until morning, and it became infested with maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them. 
02016021	Every morning each one gathered as much as was needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away. 
02016022	On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much food—two omers per person —and all the leaders of the congregation came and reported this to Moses. 
02016023	He told them, “This is what the LORD has said: ‘Tomorrow is to be a day of complete rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD. So bake what you want to bake, and boil what you want to boil. Then set aside whatever remains and keep it until morning.’” 
02016024	So they set it aside until morning as Moses had commanded, and it did not smell or contain any maggots. 
02016025	“Eat it today,” Moses said, “because today is a Sabbath to the LORD. Today you will not find anything in the field. 
02016026	For six days you may gather, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, it will not be there.” 
02016027	Yet on the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, but they did not find anything. 
02016028	Then the LORD said to Moses, “How long will you refuse to keep My commandments and instructions? 
02016029	Understand that the LORD has given you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth day He will give you bread for two days. On the seventh day, everyone must stay where he is; no one may leave his place.” 
02016030	So the people rested on the seventh day. 
02016031	Now the house of Israel called the bread manna. It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey. 
02016032	Moses said, “This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Keep an omer of manna for the generations to come, so that they may see the bread I fed you in the wilderness when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’” 
02016033	So Moses told Aaron, “Take a jar and fill it with an omer of manna. Then place it before the LORD to be preserved for the generations to come.” 
02016034	And Aaron placed it in front of the Testimony, to be preserved just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
02016035	The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a land where they could settle; they ate manna until they reached the border of Canaan. 
02016036	(Now an omer is a tenth of an ephah.) 
02017001	Then the whole congregation of Israel left the Desert of Sin, moving from place to place as the LORD commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink. 
02017002	So the people contended with Moses, “Give us water to drink.” “Why do you contend with me?” Moses replied. “Why do you test the LORD?” 
02017003	But the people thirsted for water there, and they grumbled against Moses: “Why have you brought us out of Egypt—to make us and our children and livestock die of thirst?” 
02017004	Then Moses cried out to the LORD, “What should I do with these people? A little more and they will stone me!” 
02017005	And the LORD said to Moses, “Walk on ahead of the people and take some of the elders of Israel with you. Take along in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go. 
02017006	Behold, I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb. And when you strike the rock, water will come out of it for the people to drink.” So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel. 
02017007	He named the place Massah and Meribah because the Israelites quarreled, and because they tested the LORD, saying, “Is the LORD among us or not?” 
02017008	After this, the Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim. 
02017009	So Moses said to Joshua, “Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on the hilltop with the staff of God in my hand.” 
02017010	Joshua did as Moses had instructed him and fought against the Amalekites, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 
02017011	As long as Moses held up his hands, Israel prevailed; but when he lowered them, Amalek prevailed. 
02017012	When Moses’ hands grew heavy, they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it. Then Aaron and Hur held his hands up, one on each side, so that his hands remained steady until the sun went down. 
02017013	So Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his army with the sword. 
02017014	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Write this on a scroll as a reminder and recite it to Joshua, because I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.” 
02017015	And Moses built an altar and named it The LORD Is My Banner. 
02017016	“Indeed,” he said, “a hand was lifted up toward the throne of the LORD. The LORD will war against Amalek from generation to generation.” 
02018001	Now Moses’ father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, heard about all that God had done for Moses and His people Israel, and how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt. 
02018002	After Moses had sent back his wife Zipporah, his father-in-law Jethro had received her, 
02018003	along with her two sons. One son was named Gershom, for Moses had said, “I have been a foreigner in a foreign land.” 
02018004	The other son was named Eliezer, for Moses had said, “The God of my father was my helper and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.” 
02018005	Moses’ father-in-law Jethro, along with Moses’ wife and sons, came to him in the desert, where he was encamped at the mountain of God. 
02018006	He sent word to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons.” 
02018007	So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. They greeted each other and went into the tent. 
02018008	Then Moses recounted to his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the hardships they had encountered along the way, and how the LORD had delivered them. 
02018009	And Jethro rejoiced over all the good things the LORD had done for Israel, whom He had rescued from the hand of the Egyptians. 
02018010	Jethro declared, “Blessed be the LORD, who has delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh, and who has delivered the people from the hand of the Egyptians. 
02018011	Now I know that the LORD is greater than all other gods, for He did this when they treated Israel with arrogance.” 
02018012	Then Moses’ father-in-law Jethro brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law in the presence of God. 
02018013	The next day Moses took his seat to judge the people, and they stood around him from morning until evening. 
02018014	When his father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for the people, he asked, “What is this that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone as judge, with all the people standing around you from morning till evening?” 
02018015	“Because the people come to me to inquire of God,” Moses replied. 
02018016	“Whenever they have a dispute, it is brought to me to judge between one man and another, and I make known to them the statutes and laws of God.” 
02018017	But Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “What you are doing is not good. 
02018018	Surely you and these people with you will wear yourselves out, because the task is too heavy for you. You cannot handle it alone. 
02018019	Now listen to me; I will give you some advice, and may God be with you. You must be the people’s representative before God and bring their causes to Him. 
02018020	Teach them the statutes and laws, and show them the way to live and the work they must do. 
02018021	Furthermore, select capable men from among the people—God-fearing, trustworthy men who are averse to dishonest gain. Appoint them over the people as leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens. 
02018022	Have these men judge the people at all times. Then they can bring you any major issue, but all minor cases they can judge on their own, so that your load may be lightened as they share it with you. 
02018023	If you follow this advice and God so directs you, then you will be able to endure, and all these people can go home in peace.” 
02018024	Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said. 
02018025	So Moses chose capable men from all Israel and made them heads over the people as leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens. 
02018026	And they judged the people at all times; they would bring the difficult cases to Moses, but any minor issue they would judge themselves. 
02018027	Then Moses sent his father-in-law on his way, and Jethro returned to his own land. 
02019001	In the third month, on the same day of the month that the Israelites had left the land of Egypt, they came to the Wilderness of Sinai. 
02019002	After they had set out from Rephidim, they entered the Wilderness of Sinai, and Israel camped there in front of the mountain. 
02019003	Then Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain, “This is what you are to tell the house of Jacob and explain to the sons of Israel: 
02019004	‘You have seen for yourselves what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to Myself. 
02019005	Now if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, you will be My treasured possession out of all the nations—for the whole earth is Mine. 
02019006	And unto Me you shall be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you are to speak to the Israelites.” 
02019007	So Moses went back and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all these words that the LORD had commanded him. 
02019008	And all the people answered together, “We will do everything that the LORD has spoken.” So Moses brought their words back to the LORD. 
02019009	The LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I will come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear when I speak with you, and they will always put their trust in you.” And Moses relayed to the LORD what the people had said. 
02019010	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. They must wash their clothes 
02019011	and be prepared by the third day, for on the third day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. 
02019012	And you are to set up a boundary for the people around the mountain and tell them, ‘Be careful not to go up on the mountain or touch its base. Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death. 
02019013	No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot with arrows—whether man or beast, he must not live.’ Only when the ram’s horn sounds a long blast may they approach the mountain.” 
02019014	When Moses came down from the mountain to the people, he consecrated them, and they washed their clothes. 
02019015	“Be prepared for the third day,” he said to the people. “Do not draw near to a woman.” 
02019016	On the third day, when morning came, there was thunder and lightning. A thick cloud was upon the mountain, and a very loud blast of the ram’s horn went out, so that all the people in the camp trembled. 
02019017	Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. 
02019018	Mount Sinai was completely enveloped in smoke, because the LORD had descended on it in fire. And the smoke rose like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked violently. 
02019019	And as the sound of the ram’s horn grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him in the thunder. 
02019020	The LORD descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the summit. So Moses went up, 
02019021	and the LORD said to him, “Go down and warn the people not to break through to see the LORD, lest many of them perish. 
02019022	Even the priests who approach the LORD must consecrate themselves, or the LORD will break out against them.” 
02019023	But Moses said to the LORD, “The people cannot come up Mount Sinai, for You solemnly warned us, ‘Put a boundary around the mountain and set it apart as holy.’” 
02019024	And the LORD replied, “Go down and bring Aaron with you. But the priests and the people must not break through to come up to the LORD, or He will break out against them.” 
02019025	So Moses went down to the people and spoke to them. 
02020001	And God spoke all these words: 
02020002	“I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. 
02020003	You shall have no other gods before Me. 
02020004	You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in the heavens above, on the earth below, or in the waters beneath. 
02020005	You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on their children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, 
02020006	but showing loving devotion to a thousand generations of those who love Me and keep My commandments. 
02020007	You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not leave anyone unpunished who takes His name in vain. 
02020008	Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. 
02020009	Six days you shall labor and do all your work, 
02020010	but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God, on which you must not do any work—neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant or livestock, nor the foreigner within your gates. 
02020011	For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth and the sea and all that is in them, but on the seventh day He rested. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and set it apart as holy. 
02020012	Honor your father and mother, so that your days may be long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you. 
02020013	You shall not murder. 
02020014	You shall not commit adultery. 
02020015	You shall not steal. 
02020016	You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. 
02020017	You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his manservant or maidservant, or his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.” 
02020018	When all the people witnessed the thunder and lightning, the sounding of the ram’s horn, and the mountain enveloped in smoke, they trembled and stood at a distance. 
02020019	“Speak to us yourself and we will listen,” they said to Moses. “But do not let God speak to us, or we will die.” 
02020020	“Do not be afraid,” Moses replied. “For God has come to test you, so that the fear of Him may be before you, to keep you from sinning.” 
02020021	And the people stood at a distance as Moses approached the thick darkness where God was. 
02020022	Then the LORD said to Moses, “This is what you are to tell the Israelites: ‘You have seen for yourselves that I have spoken to you from heaven. 
02020023	You are not to make any gods alongside Me; you are not to make for yourselves gods of silver or gold. 
02020024	You are to make for Me an altar of earth, and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and peace offerings, your sheep and goats and cattle. In every place where I cause My name to be remembered, I will come to you and bless you. 
02020025	Now if you make an altar of stones for Me, you must not build it with stones shaped by tools; for if you use a chisel on it, you will defile it. 
02020026	And you must not go up to My altar on steps, lest your nakedness be exposed on it.’ 
02021001	“These are the ordinances that you are to set before them: 
02021002	If you buy a Hebrew servant, he is to serve you for six years. But in the seventh year, he shall go free without paying anything. 
02021003	If he arrived alone, he is to leave alone; if he arrived with a wife, she is to leave with him. 
02021004	If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the woman and her children shall belong to her master, and only the man shall go free. 
02021005	But if the servant declares, ‘I love my master and my wife and children; I do not want to go free,’ 
02021006	then his master is to bring him before the judges. And he shall take him to the door or doorpost and pierce his ear with an awl. Then he shall serve his master for life. 
02021007	And if a man sells his daughter as a servant, she is not to go free as the menservants do. 
02021008	If she is displeasing in the eyes of her master who had designated her for himself, he must allow her to be redeemed. He has no right to sell her to foreigners, since he has broken faith with her. 
02021009	And if he chooses her for his son, he must deal with her as with a daughter. 
02021010	If he takes another wife, he must not reduce the food, clothing, or marital rights of his first wife. 
02021011	If, however, he does not provide her with these three things, she is free to go without monetary payment. 
02021012	Whoever strikes and kills a man must surely be put to death. 
02021013	If, however, he did not lie in wait, but God allowed it to happen, then I will appoint for you a place where he may flee. 
02021014	But if a man schemes and acts willfully against his neighbor to kill him, you must take him away from My altar to be put to death. 
02021015	Whoever strikes his father or mother must surely be put to death. 
02021016	Whoever kidnaps another man must be put to death, whether he sells him or the man is found in his possession. 
02021017	Anyone who curses his father or mother must surely be put to death. 
02021018	If men are quarreling and one strikes the other with a stone or a fist, and he does not die but is confined to bed, 
02021019	then the one who struck him shall go unpunished, as long as the other can get up and walk around outside with his staff. Nevertheless, he must compensate the man for his lost work and see that he is completely healed. 
02021020	If a man strikes his manservant or maidservant with a rod, and the servant dies by his hand, he shall surely be punished. 
02021021	However, if the servant gets up after a day or two, the owner shall not be punished, since the servant is his property. 
02021022	If men who are fighting strike a pregnant woman and her child is born prematurely, but there is no further injury, he shall surely be fined as the woman’s husband demands and as the court allows. 
02021023	But if a serious injury results, then you must require a life for a life— 
02021024	eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 
02021025	burn for burn, wound for wound, and stripe for stripe. 
02021026	If a man strikes and blinds the eye of his manservant or maidservant, he must let the servant go free as compensation for the eye. 
02021027	And if he knocks out the tooth of his manservant or maidservant, he must let the servant go free as compensation for the tooth. 
02021028	If an ox gores a man or woman to death, the ox must surely be stoned, and its meat must not be eaten. But the owner of the ox shall not be held responsible. 
02021029	But if the ox has a habit of goring, and its owner has been warned yet does not restrain it, and it kills a man or woman, then the ox must be stoned and its owner must also be put to death. 
02021030	If payment is demanded of him instead, he may redeem his life by paying the full amount demanded of him. 
02021031	If the ox gores a son or a daughter, it shall be done to him according to the same rule. 
02021032	If the ox gores a manservant or maidservant, the owner must pay thirty shekels of silver to the master of that servant, and the ox must be stoned. 
02021033	If a man opens or digs a pit and fails to cover it, and an ox or a donkey falls into it, 
02021034	the owner of the pit shall make restitution; he must pay its owner, and the dead animal will be his. 
02021035	If a man’s ox injures his neighbor’s ox and it dies, they must sell the live one and divide the proceeds; they also must divide the dead animal. 
02021036	But if it was known that the ox had a habit of goring, yet its owner failed to restrain it, he shall pay full compensation, ox for ox, and the dead animal will be his. 
02022001	“If a man steals an ox or a sheep and slaughters or sells it, he must repay five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep. 
02022002	If a thief is caught breaking in and is beaten to death, no one shall be guilty of bloodshed. 
02022003	But if it happens after sunrise, there is guilt for his bloodshed. A thief must make full restitution; if he has nothing, he himself shall be sold for his theft. 
02022004	If what was stolen is actually found alive in his possession—whether ox or donkey or sheep—he must pay back double. 
02022005	If a man grazes his livestock in a field or vineyard and allows them to stray so that they graze in someone else’s field, he must make restitution from the best of his own field or vineyard. 
02022006	If a fire breaks out and spreads to thornbushes so that it consumes stacked or standing grain, or the whole field, the one who started the fire must make full restitution. 
02022007	If a man gives his neighbor money or goods for safekeeping and they are stolen from the neighbor’s house, the thief, if caught, must pay back double. 
02022008	If the thief is not found, the owner of the house must appear before the judges to determine whether he has taken his neighbor’s property. 
02022009	In all cases of illegal possession of an ox, a donkey, a sheep, a garment, or any lost item that someone claims, ‘This is mine,’ both parties shall bring their cases before the judges. The one whom the judges find guilty must pay back double to his neighbor. 
02022010	If a man gives a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any other animal to be cared for by his neighbor, but it dies or is injured or stolen while no one is watching, 
02022011	an oath before the LORD shall be made between the parties to determine whether or not the man has taken his neighbor’s property. The owner must accept the oath and require no restitution. 
02022012	But if the animal was actually stolen from the neighbor, he must make restitution to the owner. 
02022013	If the animal was torn to pieces, he shall bring it as evidence; he need not make restitution for the torn carcass. 
02022014	If a man borrows an animal from his neighbor and it is injured or dies while its owner is not present, he must make full restitution. 
02022015	If the owner was present, no restitution is required. If the animal was rented, the fee covers the loss. 
02022016	If a man seduces a virgin who is not pledged in marriage and sleeps with her, he must pay the full dowry for her to be his wife. 
02022017	If her father absolutely refuses to give her to him, the man still must pay an amount comparable to the bridal price of a virgin. 
02022018	You must not allow a sorceress to live. 
02022019	Whoever lies with an animal must surely be put to death. 
02022020	If anyone sacrifices to any god other than the LORD alone, he must be set apart for destruction. 
02022021	You must not exploit or oppress a foreign resident, for you yourselves were foreigners in the land of Egypt. 
02022022	You must not mistreat any widow or orphan. 
02022023	If you do mistreat them, and they cry out to Me in distress, I will surely hear their cry. 
02022024	My anger will be kindled, and I will kill you with the sword; then your wives will become widows and your children will be fatherless. 
02022025	If you lend money to one of My people among you who is poor, you must not act as a creditor to him; you are not to charge him interest. 
02022026	If you take your neighbor’s cloak as collateral, return it to him by sunset, 
02022027	because his cloak is the only covering he has for his body. What else will he sleep in? And if he cries out to Me, I will hear, for I am compassionate. 
02022028	You must not blaspheme God or curse the ruler of your people. 
02022029	You must not hold back offerings from your granaries or vats. You are to give Me the firstborn of your sons. 
02022030	You shall do likewise with your cattle and your sheep. Let them stay with their mothers for seven days, but on the eighth day you are to give them to Me. 
02022031	You are to be My holy people. You must not eat the meat of a mauled animal found in the field; you are to throw it to the dogs. 
02023001	“You shall not spread a false report. Do not join the wicked by being a malicious witness. 
02023002	You shall not follow the crowd in wrongdoing. When you testify in a lawsuit, do not pervert justice by siding with the crowd. 
02023003	And do not show favoritism to a poor man in his lawsuit. 
02023004	If you encounter your enemy’s stray ox or donkey, you must return it to him. 
02023005	If you see the donkey of one who hates you fallen under its load, do not leave it there; you must help him with it. 
02023006	You shall not deny justice to the poor in their lawsuits. 
02023007	Stay far away from a false accusation. Do not kill the innocent or the just, for I will not acquit the guilty. 
02023008	Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds those who see and twists the words of the righteous. 
02023009	Do not oppress a foreign resident, since you yourselves know how it feels to be foreigners; for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt. 
02023010	For six years you are to sow your land and gather its produce, 
02023011	but in the seventh year you must let it rest and lie fallow, so that the poor among your people may eat from the field and the wild animals may consume what they leave. Do the same with your vineyard and olive grove. 
02023012	For six days you are to do your work, but on the seventh day you must cease, so that your ox and your donkey may rest and the son of your maidservant may be refreshed, as well as the foreign resident. 
02023013	Pay close attention to everything I have said to you. You must not invoke the names of other gods; they must not be heard on your lips. 
02023014	Three times a year you are to celebrate a feast to Me. 
02023015	You are to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread as I commanded you: At the appointed time in the month of Abib you are to eat unleavened bread for seven days, because that was the month you came out of Egypt. No one may appear before Me empty-handed. 
02023016	You are also to keep the Feast of Harvest with the firstfruits of the produce from what you sow in the field. And keep the Feast of Ingathering at the end of the year, when you gather your produce from the field. 
02023017	Three times a year all your males are to appear before the Lord GOD. 
02023018	You must not offer the blood of My sacrifices with anything leavened, nor may the fat of My feast remain until morning. 
02023019	Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the LORD your God. You must not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk. 
02023020	Behold, I am sending an angel before you to protect you along the way and to bring you to the place I have prepared. 
02023021	Pay attention to him and listen to his voice; do not defy him, for he will not forgive rebellion, since My Name is in him. 
02023022	But if you will listen carefully to his voice and do everything I say, I will be an enemy to your enemies and a foe to your foes. 
02023023	For My angel will go before you and bring you into the land of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites, and Jebusites, and I will annihilate them. 
02023024	You must not bow down to their gods or serve them or follow their practices. Instead, you are to demolish them and smash their sacred stones to pieces. 
02023025	So you shall serve the LORD your God, and He will bless your bread and your water. And I will take away sickness from among you. 
02023026	No woman in your land will miscarry or be barren; I will fulfill the number of your days. 
02023027	I will send My terror ahead of you and throw into confusion every nation you encounter. I will make all your enemies turn and run. 
02023028	I will send the hornet before you to drive the Hivites and Canaanites and Hittites out of your way. 
02023029	I will not drive them out before you in a single year; otherwise the land would become desolate and wild animals would multiply against you. 
02023030	Little by little I will drive them out ahead of you, until you become fruitful and possess the land. 
02023031	And I will establish your borders from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines, and from the desert to the Euphrates. For I will deliver the inhabitants into your hand, and you will drive them out before you. 
02023032	You shall make no covenant with them or with their gods. 
02023033	They must not remain in your land, lest they cause you to sin against Me. For if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.” 
02024001	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Come up to the LORD—you and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of Israel’s elders—and you are to worship at a distance. 
02024002	Moses alone shall approach the LORD, but the others must not come near. And the people may not go up with him.” 
02024003	When Moses came and told the people all the words and ordinances of the LORD, they all responded with one voice: “All the words that the LORD has spoken, we will do.” 
02024004	And Moses wrote down all the words of the LORD. Early the next morning he got up and built an altar at the base of the mountain, along with twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel. 
02024005	Then he sent out some young men of Israel, and they offered burnt offerings and sacrificed young bulls as peace offerings to the LORD. 
02024006	Moses took half of the blood and put it in bowls, and the other half he splattered on the altar. 
02024007	Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it to the people, who replied, “All that the LORD has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient.” 
02024008	So Moses took the blood, splattered it on the people, and said, “This is the blood of the covenant that the LORD has made with you in accordance with all these words.” 
02024009	Then Moses went up with Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, 
02024010	and they saw the God of Israel. Under His feet was a work like a pavement made of sapphire, as clear as the sky itself. 
02024011	But God did not lay His hand on the nobles of Israel; they saw Him, and they ate and drank. 
02024012	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Come up to Me on the mountain and stay here, so that I may give you the tablets of stone, with the law and commandments I have written for their instruction.” 
02024013	So Moses set out with Joshua his attendant and went up on the mountain of God. 
02024014	And he said to the elders, “Wait here for us until we return to you. Aaron and Hur are here with you. Whoever has a dispute can go to them.” 
02024015	When Moses went up on the mountain, the cloud covered it, 
02024016	and the glory of the LORD settled on Mount Sinai. For six days the cloud covered it, and on the seventh day the LORD called to Moses from within the cloud. 
02024017	And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like a consuming fire on the mountaintop in the eyes of the Israelites. 
02024018	Moses entered the cloud as he went up on the mountain, and he remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights. 
02025001	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
02025002	“Tell the Israelites to bring Me an offering. You are to receive My offering from every man whose heart compels him. 
02025003	This is the offering you are to accept from them: gold, silver, and bronze; 
02025004	blue, purple, and scarlet yarn; fine linen and goat hair; 
02025005	ram skins dyed red and fine leather; acacia wood; 
02025006	olive oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense; 
02025007	and onyx stones and gemstones to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece. 
02025008	And they are to make a sanctuary for Me, so that I may dwell among them. 
02025009	You must make the tabernacle and design all its furnishings according to the pattern I show you. 
02025010	And they are to construct an ark of acacia wood, two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high. 
02025011	Overlay it with pure gold both inside and out, and make a gold molding around it. 
02025012	Cast four gold rings for it and fasten them to its four feet, two rings on one side and two on the other. 
02025013	And make poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold. 
02025014	Insert the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, in order to carry it. 
02025015	The poles are to remain in the rings of the ark; they must not be removed. 
02025016	And place inside the ark the Testimony, which I will give you. 
02025017	And you are to construct a mercy seat of pure gold, two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide. 
02025018	Make two cherubim of hammered gold at the ends of the mercy seat, 
02025019	one cherub on one end and one on the other, all made from one piece of gold. 
02025020	And the cherubim are to have wings that spread upward, overshadowing the mercy seat. The cherubim are to face each other, looking toward the mercy seat. 
02025021	Set the mercy seat atop the ark and put the Testimony that I will give you into the ark. 
02025022	And I will meet with you there above the mercy seat, between the two cherubim that are over the ark of the Testimony; I will speak with you about all that I command you regarding the Israelites. 
02025023	You are also to make a table of acacia wood two cubits long, a cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high. 
02025024	Overlay it with pure gold and make a gold molding around it. 
02025025	And make a rim around it a handbreadth wide and put a gold molding on the rim. 
02025026	Make four gold rings for the table and fasten them to the four corners at its four legs. 
02025027	The rings are to be close to the rim, to serve as holders for the poles used to carry the table. 
02025028	Make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold, so that the table may be carried with them. 
02025029	You are also to make the plates and dishes, as well as the pitchers and bowls for pouring drink offerings. Make them out of pure gold. 
02025030	And place the Bread of the Presence on the table before Me at all times. 
02025031	Then you are to make a lampstand of pure, hammered gold. It shall be made of one piece, including its base and shaft, its cups, and its buds and petals. 
02025032	Six branches are to extend from the sides of the lampstand—three on one side and three on the other. 
02025033	There are to be three cups shaped like almond blossoms on the first branch, each with buds and petals, three on the next branch, and the same for all six branches that extend from the lampstand. 
02025034	And on the lampstand there shall be four cups shaped like almond blossoms with buds and petals. 
02025035	For the six branches that extend from the lampstand, a bud must be under the first pair of branches, a bud under the second pair, and a bud under the third pair. 
02025036	The buds and branches are to be all of one piece with the lampstand, hammered out of pure gold. 
02025037	Make seven lamps and set them up on the lampstand so that they illuminate the area in front of it. 
02025038	The wick trimmers and their trays must be of pure gold. 
02025039	The lampstand and all these utensils shall be made from a talent of pure gold. 
02025040	See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain. 
02026001	“You are to construct the tabernacle itself with ten curtains of finely spun linen, each with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and cherubim skillfully worked into them. 
02026002	Each curtain shall be twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide —all curtains the same size. 
02026003	Five of the curtains are to be joined together, and the other five joined as well. 
02026004	Make loops of blue material on the edge of the end curtain in the first set, and do the same for the end curtain in the second set. 
02026005	Make fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the second set, so that the loops line up opposite one another. 
02026006	Make fifty gold clasps as well, and join the curtains together with the clasps, so that the tabernacle will be a unit. 
02026007	You are to make curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle—eleven curtains in all. 
02026008	Each of the eleven curtains is to be the same size—thirty cubits long and four cubits wide. 
02026009	Join five of the curtains into one set and the other six into another. Then fold the sixth curtain over double at the front of the tent. 
02026010	Make fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in the first set, and fifty loops along the edge of the corresponding curtain in the second set. 
02026011	Make fifty bronze clasps and put them through the loops to join the tent together as a unit. 
02026012	As for the overlap that remains of the tent curtains, the half curtain that is left over shall hang down over the back of the tabernacle. 
02026013	And the tent curtains will be a cubit longer on either side, and the excess will hang over the sides of the tabernacle to cover it. 
02026014	Also make a covering for the tent out of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of fine leather. 
02026015	You are to construct upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle. 
02026016	Each frame is to be ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide. 
02026017	Two tenons must be connected to each other for each frame. Make all the frames of the tabernacle in this way. 
02026018	Construct twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle, 
02026019	with forty silver bases under the twenty frames—two bases for each frame, one under each tenon. 
02026020	For the second side of the tabernacle, the north side, make twenty frames 
02026021	and forty silver bases—two bases under each frame. 
02026022	Make six frames for the rear of the tabernacle, the west side, 
02026023	and two frames for the two back corners of the tabernacle, 
02026024	coupled together from bottom to top and fitted into a single ring. These will serve as the two corners. 
02026025	So there are to be eight frames and sixteen silver bases—two under each frame. 
02026026	You are also to make five crossbars of acacia wood for the frames on one side of the tabernacle, 
02026027	five for those on the other side, and five for those on the rear side of the tabernacle, to the west. 
02026028	The central crossbar in the middle of the frames shall extend from one end to the other. 
02026029	Overlay the frames with gold and make gold rings to hold the crossbars. Also overlay the crossbars with gold. 
02026030	So you are to set up the tabernacle according to the pattern shown you on the mountain. 
02026031	Make a veil of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen, with cherubim skillfully worked into it. 
02026032	Hang it with gold hooks on four posts of acacia wood, overlaid with gold and standing on four silver bases. 
02026033	And hang the veil from the clasps and place the ark of the Testimony behind the veil. So the veil will separate the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place. 
02026034	Put the mercy seat on the ark of the Testimony in the Most Holy Place. 
02026035	And place the table outside the veil on the north side of the tabernacle, and put the lampstand opposite the table, on the south side. 
02026036	For the entrance to the tent, you are to make a curtain embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen. 
02026037	Make five posts of acacia wood for the curtain, overlay them with gold hooks, and cast five bronze bases for them. 
02027001	“You are to build an altar of acacia wood. The altar must be square, five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high. 
02027002	Make a horn on each of its four corners, so that the horns are of one piece, and overlay it with bronze. 
02027003	Make all its utensils of bronze—its pots for removing ashes, its shovels, its sprinkling bowls, its meat forks, and its firepans. 
02027004	Construct for it a grate of bronze mesh, and make a bronze ring at each of the four corners of the mesh. 
02027005	Set the grate beneath the ledge of the altar, so that the mesh comes halfway up the altar. 
02027006	Additionally, make poles of acacia wood for the altar and overlay them with bronze. 
02027007	The poles are to be inserted into the rings so that the poles are on two sides of the altar when it is carried. 
02027008	Construct the altar with boards so that it is hollow. It is to be made just as you were shown on the mountain. 
02027009	You are also to make a courtyard for the tabernacle. On the south side of the courtyard make curtains of finely spun linen, a hundred cubits long on one side, 
02027010	with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, and silver hooks and bands on the posts. 
02027011	Likewise there are to be curtains on the north side, a hundred cubits long, with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, and with silver hooks and bands on the posts. 
02027012	The curtains on the west side of the courtyard shall be fifty cubits wide, with ten posts and ten bases. 
02027013	The east side of the courtyard, toward the sunrise, is to be fifty cubits wide. 
02027014	Make the curtains on one side fifteen cubits long, with three posts and three bases, 
02027015	and the curtains on the other side fifteen cubits long, with three posts and three bases. 
02027016	The gate of the courtyard shall be twenty cubits long, with a curtain embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen. It shall have four posts and four bases. 
02027017	All the posts around the courtyard shall have silver bands, silver hooks, and bronze bases. 
02027018	The entire courtyard shall be a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide, with curtains of finely spun linen five cubits high, and with bronze bases. 
02027019	All the utensils of the tabernacle for every use, including all its tent pegs and the tent pegs of the courtyard, shall be made of bronze. 
02027020	And you are to command the Israelites to bring you pure oil of pressed olives for the light, to keep the lamps burning continually. 
02027021	In the Tent of Meeting, outside the veil that is in front of the Testimony, Aaron and his sons are to tend the lamps before the LORD from evening until morning. This is to be a permanent statute for the Israelites for the generations to come. 
02028001	“Next, have your brother Aaron brought to you from among the Israelites, along with his sons Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar, to serve Me as priests. 
02028002	Make holy garments for your brother Aaron, to give him glory and splendor. 
02028003	You are to instruct all the skilled craftsmen, whom I have filled with a spirit of wisdom, to make garments for Aaron’s consecration, so that he may serve Me as priest. 
02028004	These are the garments that they shall make: a breastpiece, an ephod, a robe, a woven tunic, a turban, and a sash. They are to make these holy garments for your brother Aaron and his sons, so that they may serve Me as priests. 
02028005	They shall use gold, along with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine linen. 
02028006	They are to make the ephod of finely spun linen embroidered with gold, and with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn. 
02028007	It shall have two shoulder pieces attached at two of its corners, so it can be fastened. 
02028008	And the skillfully woven waistband of the ephod must be of one piece, of the same workmanship—with gold, with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and with finely spun linen. 
02028009	Take two onyx stones and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel: 
02028010	six of their names on one stone and the remaining six on the other, in the order of their birth. 
02028011	Engrave the names of the sons of Israel on the two stones the way a gem cutter engraves a seal. Then mount the stones in gold filigree settings. 
02028012	Fasten both stones on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel. Aaron is to bear their names on his two shoulders as a memorial before the LORD. 
02028013	Fashion gold filigree settings 
02028014	and two chains of pure gold, made of braided cord work; and attach these chains to the settings. 
02028015	You are also to make a breastpiece of judgment with the same workmanship as the ephod. Construct it with gold, with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and with finely spun linen. 
02028016	It must be square when folded over double, a span long and a span wide. 
02028017	And mount on it a setting of gemstones, four rows of stones: In the first row there shall be a ruby, a topaz, and an emerald; 
02028018	in the second row a turquoise, a sapphire, and a diamond; 
02028019	in the third row a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; 
02028020	and in the fourth row a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. Mount these stones in gold filigree settings. 
02028021	The twelve stones are to correspond to the names of the sons of Israel, each engraved like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes. 
02028022	For the breastpiece, make braided chains like cords of pure gold. 
02028023	You are also to make two gold rings and fasten them to the two corners of the breastpiece. 
02028024	Then fasten the two gold chains to the two gold rings at the corners of the breastpiece, 
02028025	and fasten the other ends of the two chains to the two filigree settings, attaching them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front. 
02028026	Make two more gold rings and attach them to the other two corners of the breastpiece, on the inside edge next to the ephod. 
02028027	Make two additional gold rings and attach them to the bottom of the two shoulder pieces of the ephod, on its front, near its seam just above its woven waistband. 
02028028	The rings of the breastpiece shall be tied to the rings of the ephod with a cord of blue yarn, so that the breastpiece is above the waistband of the ephod and does not swing out from the ephod. 
02028029	Whenever Aaron enters the Holy Place, he shall bear the names of the sons of Israel over his heart on the breastpiece of judgment, as a continual reminder before the LORD. 
02028030	And place the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece of judgment, so that they will also be over Aaron’s heart whenever he comes before the LORD. Aaron will continually carry the judgment of the sons of Israel over his heart before the LORD. 
02028031	You are to make the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloth, 
02028032	with an opening at its top in the center. Around the opening shall be a woven collar with an opening like that of a garment, so that it will not tear. 
02028033	Make pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn all the way around the lower hem, with gold bells between them, 
02028034	alternating the gold bells and pomegranates around the lower hem of the robe. 
02028035	Aaron must wear the robe whenever he ministers, and its sound will be heard when he enters or exits the sanctuary before the LORD, so that he will not die. 
02028036	You are to make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it as on a seal: HOLY TO THE LORD. 
02028037	Fasten to it a blue cord to mount it on the turban; it shall be on the front of the turban. 
02028038	And it will be worn on Aaron’s forehead, so that he may bear the iniquity of the holy things that the sons of Israel consecrate with regard to all their holy gifts. It shall always be on his forehead, so that they may be acceptable before the LORD. 
02028039	You are to weave the tunic with fine linen, make the turban of fine linen, and fashion an embroidered sash. 
02028040	Make tunics, sashes, and headbands for Aaron’s sons, to give them glory and splendor. 
02028041	After you put these garments on your brother Aaron and his sons, anoint them, ordain them, and consecrate them so that they may serve Me as priests. 
02028042	Make linen undergarments to cover their bare flesh, extending from waist to thigh. 
02028043	Aaron and his sons must wear them whenever they enter the Tent of Meeting or approach the altar to minister in the Holy Place, so that they will not incur guilt and die. This is to be a permanent statute for Aaron and his descendants. 
02029001	“Now this is what you are to do to consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve Me as priests: Take a young bull and two rams without blemish, 
02029002	along with unleavened bread, unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil. Make them out of fine wheat flour, 
02029003	put them in a basket, and present them in the basket, along with the bull and the two rams. 
02029004	Then present Aaron and his sons at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and wash them with water. 
02029005	Take the garments and clothe Aaron with the tunic, the robe of the ephod, the ephod itself, and the breastplate. Fasten the ephod on him with its woven waistband. 
02029006	Put the turban on his head and attach the holy diadem to the turban. 
02029007	Then take the anointing oil and anoint him by pouring it on his head. 
02029008	Present his sons as well and clothe them with tunics. 
02029009	Wrap the sashes around Aaron and his sons and tie headbands on them. The priesthood shall be theirs by a permanent statute. In this way you are to ordain Aaron and his sons. 
02029010	You are to present the bull at the front of the Tent of Meeting, and Aaron and his sons are to lay their hands on its head. 
02029011	And you shall slaughter the bull before the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 
02029012	Take some of the blood of the bull and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger; then pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. 
02029013	Take all the fat that covers the entrails and the lobe of the liver, and both kidneys with the fat on them, and burn them on the altar. 
02029014	But burn the flesh of the bull and its hide and dung outside the camp; it is a sin offering. 
02029015	Take one of the rams, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head. 
02029016	You are to slaughter the ram, take its blood, and splatter it on all sides of the altar. 
02029017	Cut the ram into pieces, wash the entrails and legs, and place them with its head and other pieces. 
02029018	Then burn the entire ram on the altar; it is a burnt offering to the LORD, a pleasing aroma, a food offering to the LORD. 
02029019	Take the second ram, and Aaron and his sons are to lay their hands on its head. 
02029020	Slaughter the ram, take some of its blood, and put it on the right earlobes of Aaron and his sons, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. Splatter the remaining blood on all sides of the altar. 
02029021	And take some of the blood on the altar and some of the anointing oil and sprinkle it on Aaron and his garments, as well as on his sons and their garments. Then he and his garments will be consecrated, as well as his sons and their garments. 
02029022	Take the fat from the ram, the fat tail, the fat covering the entrails, the lobe of the liver, both kidneys with the fat on them, and the right thigh (since this is a ram for ordination), 
02029023	along with one loaf of bread, one cake of bread made with oil, and one wafer from the basket of unleavened bread that is before the LORD. 
02029024	Put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons and wave them before the LORD as a wave offering. 
02029025	Then take them from their hands and burn them on the altar atop the burnt offering as a pleasing aroma before the LORD; it is a food offering to the LORD. 
02029026	Take the breast of the ram of Aaron’s ordination and wave it before the LORD as a wave offering, and it will be your portion. 
02029027	Consecrate for Aaron and his sons the breast of the wave offering that is waved and the thigh of the heave offering that is lifted up from the ram of ordination. 
02029028	This will belong to Aaron and his sons as a regular portion from the Israelites, for it is the heave offering the Israelites will make to the LORD from their peace offerings. 
02029029	The holy garments that belong to Aaron will belong to his sons after him, so they can be anointed and ordained in them. 
02029030	The son who succeeds him as priest and enters the Tent of Meeting to minister in the Holy Place must wear them for seven days. 
02029031	You are to take the ram of ordination and boil its flesh in a holy place. 
02029032	At the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, Aaron and his sons are to eat the meat of the ram and the bread that is in the basket. 
02029033	They must eat those things by which atonement was made for their ordination and consecration. But no outsider may eat them, because these things are sacred. 
02029034	And if any of the meat of ordination or any bread is left until the morning, you are to burn up the remainder. It must not be eaten, because it is sacred. 
02029035	This is what you are to do for Aaron and his sons based on all that I have commanded you, taking seven days to ordain them. 
02029036	Sacrifice a bull as a sin offering each day for atonement. Purify the altar by making atonement for it, and anoint it to consecrate it. 
02029037	For seven days you shall make atonement for the altar and consecrate it. Then the altar will become most holy; whatever touches the altar will be holy. 
02029038	This is what you are to offer regularly on the altar, each day: two lambs that are a year old. 
02029039	Offer one lamb in the morning and the other at twilight. 
02029040	With the first lamb offer a tenth of an ephah of fine flour, mixed with a quarter hin of oil from pressed olives, and a drink offering of a quarter hin of wine. 
02029041	And offer the second lamb at twilight with the same grain offering and drink offering as in the morning, as a pleasing aroma, a food offering to the LORD. 
02029042	For the generations to come, this burnt offering shall be made regularly at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting before the LORD, where I will meet you to speak with you. 
02029043	I will also meet with the Israelites there, and that place will be consecrated by My glory. 
02029044	So I will consecrate the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and I will consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve Me as priests. 
02029045	Then I will dwell among the Israelites and be their God. 
02029046	And they will know that I am the LORD their God, who brought them out of the land of Egypt so that I might dwell among them. I am the LORD their God. 
02030001	“You are also to make an altar of acacia wood for the burning of incense. 
02030002	It is to be square, a cubit long, a cubit wide, and two cubits high. Its horns must be of one piece. 
02030003	Overlay with pure gold the top and all the sides and horns, and make a molding of gold around it. 
02030004	And make two gold rings below the molding on opposite sides to hold the poles used to carry it. 
02030005	Make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold. 
02030006	Place the altar in front of the veil that is before the ark of the Testimony —before the mercy seat that is over the Testimony—where I will meet with you. 
02030007	And Aaron is to burn fragrant incense on it every morning when he tends the lamps. 
02030008	When Aaron sets up the lamps at twilight, he must burn the incense perpetually before the LORD for the generations to come. 
02030009	On this altar you must not offer unauthorized incense or a burnt offering or grain offering; nor are you to pour a drink offering on it. 
02030010	Once a year Aaron shall make atonement on the horns of the altar. Throughout your generations he shall make atonement on it annually with the blood of the sin offering of atonement. The altar is most holy to the LORD.” 
02030011	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
02030012	“When you take a census of the Israelites to number them, each man must pay the LORD a ransom for his life when he is counted. Then no plague will come upon them when they are numbered. 
02030013	Everyone who crosses over to those counted must pay a half shekel, according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs. This half shekel is an offering to the LORD. 
02030014	Everyone twenty years of age or older who crosses over must give this offering to the LORD. 
02030015	In making the offering to the LORD to atone for your lives, the rich shall not give more than a half shekel, nor shall the poor give less. 
02030016	Take the atonement money from the Israelites and use it for the service of the Tent of Meeting. It will serve as a memorial for the Israelites before the LORD to make atonement for your lives.” 
02030017	And the LORD said to Moses, 
02030018	“You are to make a bronze basin with a bronze stand for washing. Set it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water in it, 
02030019	with which Aaron and his sons are to wash their hands and feet. 
02030020	Whenever they enter the Tent of Meeting or approach the altar to minister by presenting a food offering to the LORD, they must wash with water so that they will not die. 
02030021	Thus they are to wash their hands and feet so that they will not die; this shall be a permanent statute for Aaron and his descendants for the generations to come.” 
02030022	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
02030023	“Take the finest spices: 500 shekels of liquid myrrh, half that amount (250 shekels) of fragrant cinnamon, 250 shekels of fragrant cane, 
02030024	500 shekels of cassia —all according to the sanctuary shekel—and a hin of olive oil. 
02030025	Prepare from these a sacred anointing oil, a fragrant blend, the work of a perfumer; it will be a sacred anointing oil. 
02030026	Use this oil to anoint the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the Testimony, 
02030027	the table and all its utensils, the lampstand and its utensils, the altar of incense, 
02030028	the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the basin with its stand. 
02030029	You are to consecrate them so that they will be most holy. Whatever touches them shall be holy. 
02030030	Anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate them to serve Me as priests. 
02030031	And you are to tell the Israelites, ‘This will be My sacred anointing oil for the generations to come. 
02030032	It must not be used to anoint an ordinary man, and you must not make anything like it with the same formula. It is holy, and it must be holy to you. 
02030033	Anyone who mixes perfume like it or puts it on an outsider shall be cut off from his people.’” 
02030034	The LORD also said to Moses, “Take fragrant spices—gum resin, onycha, galbanum, and pure frankincense—in equal measures, 
02030035	and make a fragrant blend of incense, the work of a perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy. 
02030036	Grind some of it into fine powder and place it in front of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you. It shall be most holy to you. 
02030037	You are never to use this formula to make incense for yourselves; you shall regard it as holy to the LORD. 
02030038	Anyone who makes something like it to enjoy its fragrance shall be cut off from his people.” 
02031001	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
02031002	“See, I have called by name Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. 
02031003	And I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with skill, ability, and knowledge in all kinds of craftsmanship, 
02031004	to design artistic works in gold, silver, and bronze, 
02031005	to cut gemstones for settings, and to carve wood, so that he may be a master of every craft. 
02031006	Moreover, I have selected Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, as his assistant. I have also given skill to all the craftsmen, that they may fashion all that I have commanded you: 
02031007	the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the Testimony and the mercy seat upon it, and all the other furnishings of the tent— 
02031008	the table with its utensils, the pure gold lampstand with all its utensils, the altar of incense, 
02031009	the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin with its stand— 
02031010	as well as the woven garments, both the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons to serve as priests, 
02031011	in addition to the anointing oil and fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They are to make them according to all that I have commanded you.” 
02031012	And the LORD said to Moses, 
02031013	“Tell the Israelites, ‘Surely you must keep My Sabbaths, for this will be a sign between Me and you for the generations to come, so that you may know that I am the LORD who sanctifies you. 
02031014	Keep the Sabbath, for it is holy to you. Anyone who profanes it must surely be put to death. Whoever does any work on that day must be cut off from among his people. 
02031015	For six days work may be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of complete rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day must surely be put to death. 
02031016	The Israelites must keep the Sabbath, celebrating it as a permanent covenant for the generations to come. 
02031017	It is a sign between Me and the Israelites forever; for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, but on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed.’” 
02031018	When the LORD had finished speaking with Moses on Mount Sinai, He gave him the two tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God. 
02032001	Now when the people saw that Moses was delayed in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, “Come, make us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him!” 
02032002	So Aaron told them, “Take off the gold earrings that are on your wives and sons and daughters, and bring them to me.” 
02032003	Then all the people took off their gold earrings and brought them to Aaron. 
02032004	He took the gold from their hands, and with an engraving tool he fashioned it into a molten calf. And they said, “These, O Israel, are your gods, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!” 
02032005	When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before the calf and proclaimed: “Tomorrow shall be a feast to the LORD.” 
02032006	So the next day they arose, offered burnt offerings, and presented peace offerings. And the people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry. 
02032007	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go down at once, for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves. 
02032008	How quickly they have turned aside from the way that I commanded them! They have made for themselves a molten calf and have bowed down to it. They have sacrificed to it and said, ‘These, O Israel, are your gods, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.’” 
02032009	The LORD also said to Moses, “I have seen this people, and they are indeed a stiff-necked people. 
02032010	Now leave Me alone, so that My anger may burn against them and consume them. Then I will make you into a great nation.” 
02032011	But Moses sought the favor of the LORD his God, saying, “O LORD, why does Your anger burn against Your people, whom You brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand? 
02032012	Why should the Egyptians declare, ‘He brought them out with evil intent, to kill them in the mountains and wipe them from the face of the earth’? Turn from Your fierce anger and relent from doing harm to Your people. 
02032013	Remember Your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, to whom You swore by Your very self when You declared, ‘I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky, and I will give your descendants all this land that I have promised, and it shall be their inheritance forever.’” 
02032014	So the LORD relented from the calamity He had threatened to bring on His people. 
02032015	Then Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides, front and back. 
02032016	The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets. 
02032017	When Joshua heard the sound of the people shouting, he said to Moses, “The sound of war is in the camp.” 
02032018	But Moses replied: “It is neither the cry of victory nor the cry of defeat; I hear the sound of singing!” 
02032019	As Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, he burned with anger and threw the tablets out of his hands, shattering them at the base of the mountain. 
02032020	Then he took the calf they had made, burned it in the fire, ground it to powder, and scattered the powder over the face of the water. Then he forced the Israelites to drink it. 
02032021	“What did this people do to you,” Moses asked Aaron, “that you have led them into so great a sin?” 
02032022	“Do not be enraged, my lord,” Aaron replied. “You yourself know that the people are intent on evil. 
02032023	They told me, ‘Make us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him!’ 
02032024	So I said to them, ‘Whoever has gold, let him take it off,’ and they gave it to me. And when I threw it into the fire, out came this calf!” 
02032025	Moses saw that the people were out of control, for Aaron had let them run wild and become a laughingstock to their enemies. 
02032026	So Moses stood at the entrance to the camp and said, “Whoever is for the LORD, come to me.” And all the Levites gathered around him. 
02032027	He told them, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Each of you men is to fasten his sword to his side, go back and forth through the camp from gate to gate, and slay his brother, his friend, and his neighbor.’” 
02032028	The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people fell dead. 
02032029	Afterward, Moses said, “Today you have been ordained for service to the LORD, since each man went against his son and his brother; so the LORD has bestowed a blessing on you this day.” 
02032030	The next day Moses said to the people, “You have committed a great sin. Now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.” 
02032031	So Moses returned to the LORD and said, “Oh, what a great sin these people have committed! They have made gods of gold for themselves. 
02032032	Yet now, if You would only forgive their sin.... But if not, please blot me out of the book that You have written.” 
02032033	The LORD replied to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot out of My book. 
02032034	Now go, lead the people to the place I described. Behold, My angel shall go before you. But on the day I settle accounts, I will punish them for their sin.” 
02032035	And the LORD sent a plague on the people because of what they had done with the calf that Aaron had made. 
02033001	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Leave this place, you and the people you brought up out of the land of Egypt, and go to the land that I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob when I said, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ 
02033002	And I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 
02033003	Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go with you, because you are a stiff-necked people; otherwise, I might destroy you on the way.” 
02033004	When the people heard this bad news, they went into mourning, and no one put on any of his jewelry. 
02033005	For the LORD had said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites, ‘You are a stiff-necked people. If I should go with you for a single moment, I would destroy you. Now take off your jewelry, and I will decide what to do with you.’” 
02033006	So the Israelites stripped themselves of their jewelry from Mount Horeb onward. 
02033007	Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it at a distance outside the camp. He called it the Tent of Meeting, and anyone inquiring of the LORD would go to the Tent of Meeting outside the camp. 
02033008	Then, whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would stand at the entrances to their own tents and watch Moses until he entered the tent. 
02033009	As Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and remain at the entrance, and the LORD would speak with Moses. 
02033010	When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent, they would stand up and worship, each one at the entrance to his own tent. 
02033011	Thus the LORD would speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his young assistant Joshua son of Nun would not leave the tent. 
02033012	Then Moses said to the LORD, “Look, You have been telling me, ‘Lead this people up,’ but You have not let me know whom You will send with me. Yet You have said, ‘I know you by name, and you have found favor in My sight.’ 
02033013	Now if indeed I have found favor in Your sight, please let me know Your ways, that I may know You and find favor in Your sight. Remember that this nation is Your people.” 
02033014	And the LORD answered, “My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.” 
02033015	“If Your Presence does not go with us,” Moses replied, “do not lead us up from here. 
02033016	For how then can it be known that Your people and I have found favor in Your sight, unless You go with us? How else will we be distinguished from all the other people on the face of the earth?” 
02033017	So the LORD said to Moses, “I will do this very thing you have asked, for you have found favor in My sight, and I know you by name.” 
02033018	Then Moses said, “Please show me Your glory.” 
02033019	“I will cause all My goodness to pass before you,” the LORD replied, “and I will proclaim My name—the LORD—in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.” 
02033020	But He added, “You cannot see My face, for no one can see Me and live.” 
02033021	The LORD continued, “There is a place near Me where you are to stand upon a rock, 
02033022	and when My glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft of the rock and cover you with My hand until I have passed by. 
02033023	Then I will take My hand away, and you will see My back; but My face must not be seen.” 
02034001	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the originals, and I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. 
02034002	Be ready in the morning, and come up on Mount Sinai to present yourself before Me on the mountaintop. 
02034003	No one may go up with you; in fact, no one may be seen anywhere on the mountain—not even the flocks or herds may graze in front of the mountain.” 
02034004	So Moses chiseled out two stone tablets like the originals. He rose early in the morning, and taking the two stone tablets in his hands, he went up Mount Sinai as the LORD had commanded him. 
02034005	And the LORD descended in a cloud, stood with him there, and proclaimed His name, the LORD. 
02034006	Then the LORD passed in front of Moses and called out: “The LORD, the LORD God, is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion and faithfulness, 
02034007	maintaining loving devotion to a thousand generations, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin. Yet He will by no means leave the guilty unpunished; He will visit the iniquity of the fathers on their children and grandchildren to the third and fourth generations.” 
02034008	Moses immediately bowed down to the ground and worshiped. 
02034009	“O Lord,” he said, “if I have indeed found favor in Your sight, my Lord, please go with us. Although this is a stiff-necked people, forgive our iniquity and sin, and take us as Your inheritance.” 
02034010	And the LORD said, “Behold, I am making a covenant. Before all your people I will perform wonders that have never been done in any nation in all the world. All the people among whom you live will see the LORD’s work, for it is an awesome thing that I am doing with you. 
02034011	Observe what I command you this day. I will drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 
02034012	Be careful not to make a treaty with the inhabitants of the land you are entering, lest they become a snare in your midst. 
02034013	Rather, you must tear down their altars, smash their sacred stones, and chop down their Asherah poles. 
02034014	For you must not worship any other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God. 
02034015	Do not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to them, they will invite you, and you will eat their sacrifices. 
02034016	And when you take some of their daughters as brides for your sons, their daughters will prostitute themselves to their gods and cause your sons to do the same. 
02034017	You shall make no molten gods for yourselves. 
02034018	You are to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days at the appointed time in the month of Abib, you are to eat unleavened bread as I commanded you. For in the month of Abib you came out of Egypt. 
02034019	The first offspring of every womb belongs to Me, including all the firstborn males among your livestock, whether cattle or sheep. 
02034020	You must redeem the firstborn of a donkey with a lamb; but if you do not redeem it, you are to break its neck. You must redeem all the firstborn of your sons. No one shall appear before Me empty-handed. 
02034021	Six days you shall labor, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even in the seasons of plowing and harvesting, you must rest. 
02034022	And you are to celebrate the Feast of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the year. 
02034023	Three times a year all your males are to appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel. 
02034024	For I will drive out the nations before you and enlarge your borders, and no one will covet your land when you go up three times a year to appear before the LORD your God. 
02034025	Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to Me along with anything leavened, and do not let any of the sacrifice from the Passover Feast remain until morning. 
02034026	Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the LORD your God. You must not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.” 
02034027	The LORD also said to Moses, “Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.” 
02034028	So Moses was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water. He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant—the Ten Commandments. 
02034029	And when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands, he was unaware that his face had become radiant from speaking with the LORD. 
02034030	Aaron and all the Israelites looked at Moses, and behold, his face was radiant. And they were afraid to approach him. 
02034031	But Moses called out to them; so Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses spoke to them. 
02034032	And after this all the Israelites came near, and Moses commanded them to do everything that the LORD had told him on Mount Sinai. 
02034033	When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face. 
02034034	But whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with Him, he would remove the veil until he came out. And when he came out, he would tell the Israelites what he had been commanded, 
02034035	and the Israelites would see that the face of Moses was radiant. So Moses would put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with the LORD. 
02035001	Then Moses assembled the whole congregation of Israel and said to them, “These are the things that the LORD has commanded you to do: 
02035002	For six days work may be done, but the seventh day shall be your holy day, a Sabbath of complete rest to the LORD. Whoever does any work on that day must be put to death. 
02035003	Do not light a fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day.” 
02035004	Moses also told the whole congregation of Israel, “This is what the LORD has commanded: 
02035005	Take from among you an offering to the LORD. Let everyone whose heart is willing bring an offering to the LORD: gold, silver, and bronze; 
02035006	blue, purple, and scarlet yarn; fine linen and goat hair; 
02035007	ram skins dyed red and fine leather; acacia wood; 
02035008	olive oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense; 
02035009	and onyx stones and gemstones to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece. 
02035010	Let every skilled craftsman among you come and make everything that the LORD has commanded: 
02035011	the tabernacle with its tent and covering, its clasps and frames, its crossbars, posts, and bases; 
02035012	the ark with its poles and mercy seat, and the veil to shield it; 
02035013	the table with its poles, all its utensils, and the Bread of the Presence; 
02035014	the lampstand for light with its accessories and lamps and oil for the light; 
02035015	the altar of incense with its poles; the anointing oil and fragrant incense; the curtain for the doorway at the entrance to the tabernacle; 
02035016	the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grate, its poles, and all its utensils; the basin with its stand; 
02035017	the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the gate of the courtyard; 
02035018	the tent pegs for the tabernacle and for the courtyard, along with their ropes; 
02035019	and the woven garments for ministering in the holy place—both the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons to serve as priests.” 
02035020	Then the whole congregation of Israel withdrew from the presence of Moses. 
02035021	And everyone whose heart stirred him and whose spirit prompted him came and brought an offering to the LORD for the work on the Tent of Meeting, for all its services, and for the holy garments. 
02035022	So all who had willing hearts, both men and women, came and brought brooches and earrings, rings and necklaces, and all kinds of gold jewelry. And they all presented their gold as a wave offering to the LORD. 
02035023	Everyone who had blue, purple, or scarlet yarn, or fine linen, goat hair, ram skins dyed red, or articles of fine leather, brought them. 
02035024	And all who could present an offering of silver or bronze brought it as a contribution to the LORD. Also, everyone who had acacia wood for any part of the service brought it. 
02035025	Every skilled woman spun with her hands and brought what she had spun: blue, purple, or scarlet yarn, or fine linen. 
02035026	And all the skilled women whose hearts were stirred spun the goat hair. 
02035027	The leaders brought onyx stones and gemstones to mount on the ephod and breastpiece, 
02035028	as well as spices and olive oil for the light, for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense. 
02035029	So all the men and women of the Israelites whose hearts prompted them brought a freewill offering to the LORD for all the work that the LORD through Moses had commanded them to do. 
02035030	Then Moses said to the Israelites, “See, the LORD has called by name Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. 
02035031	And He has filled him with the Spirit of God, with skill, ability, and knowledge in all kinds of craftsmanship, 
02035032	to design artistic works in gold, silver, and bronze, 
02035033	to cut gemstones for settings, and to carve wood, so that he may be a master of every artistic craft. 
02035034	And the LORD has given both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, the ability to teach others. 
02035035	He has filled them with skill to do all kinds of work as engravers, designers, embroiderers in blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen, and as weavers—as artistic designers of every kind of craft. 
02036001	“So Bezalel, Oholiab, and every skilled person are to carry out everything commanded by the LORD, who has given them skill and ability to know how to perform all the work of constructing the sanctuary.” 
02036002	Then Moses summoned Bezalel, Oholiab, and every skilled person whom the LORD had gifted—everyone whose heart stirred him to come and do the work. 
02036003	They received from Moses all the contributions that the Israelites had brought to carry out the service of constructing the sanctuary. Meanwhile, the people continued to bring freewill offerings morning after morning, 
02036004	so that all the skilled craftsmen who were doing all the work on the sanctuary left their work 
02036005	and said to Moses, “The people are bringing more than enough for doing the work the LORD has commanded us to do.” 
02036006	After Moses had given an order, they sent a proclamation throughout the camp: “No man or woman should make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary.” So the people were restrained from bringing more, 
02036007	since what they already had was more than enough to perform all the work. 
02036008	All the skilled craftsmen among the workmen made the ten curtains for the tabernacle. They were made of finely spun linen, as well as blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, with cherubim skillfully worked into them. 
02036009	Each curtain was twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide; all the curtains were the same size. 
02036010	And he joined five of the curtains together, and the other five he joined as well. 
02036011	He made loops of blue material on the edge of the end curtain in the first set, and also on the end curtain in the second set. 
02036012	He made fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the second set, so that the loops lined up opposite one another. 
02036013	He also made fifty gold clasps to join the curtains together, so that the tabernacle was a unit. 
02036014	He then made curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle—eleven curtains in all. 
02036015	Each of the eleven curtains was the same size—thirty cubits long and four cubits wide. 
02036016	He joined five of the curtains into one set and the other six into another. 
02036017	He made fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in the first set, and fifty loops along the edge of the corresponding curtain in the second set. 
02036018	He also made fifty bronze clasps to join the tent together as a unit. 
02036019	Additionally, he made for the tent a covering of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of fine leather. 
02036020	Next, he constructed upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle. 
02036021	Each frame was ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide. 
02036022	Two tenons were connected to each other for each frame. He made all the frames of the tabernacle in this way. 
02036023	He constructed twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle, 
02036024	with forty silver bases to put under the twenty frames—two bases for each frame, one under each tenon. 
02036025	For the second side of the tabernacle, the north side, he made twenty frames 
02036026	and forty silver bases—two bases under each frame. 
02036027	He made six frames for the rear of the tabernacle, the west side, 
02036028	and two frames for the two back corners of the tabernacle, 
02036029	coupled together from bottom to top and fitted into a single ring. He made both corners in this way. 
02036030	So there were eight frames and sixteen silver bases—two under each frame. 
02036031	He also made five crossbars of acacia wood for the frames on one side of the tabernacle, 
02036032	five for those on the other side, and five for those on the rear side of the tabernacle, to the west. 
02036033	He made the central crossbar to run through the center of the frames, from one end to the other. 
02036034	And he overlaid the frames with gold and made gold rings to hold the crossbars. He also overlaid the crossbars with gold. 
02036035	Next, he made the veil of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen, with cherubim skillfully worked into it. 
02036036	He also made four posts of acacia wood for it and overlaid them with gold, along with gold hooks; and he cast four silver bases for the posts. 
02036037	For the entrance to the tent, he made a curtain embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen, 
02036038	together with five posts and their hooks. He overlaid the tops of the posts and their bands with gold, and their five bases were bronze. 
02037001	Bezalel went on to construct the ark of acacia wood, two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high. 
02037002	He overlaid it with pure gold, both inside and out, and made a gold molding around it. 
02037003	And he cast four gold rings for its four feet, two rings on one side and two on the other. 
02037004	Then he made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 
02037005	He inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark in order to carry it. 
02037006	He constructed a mercy seat of pure gold, two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide. 
02037007	He made two cherubim of hammered gold at the ends of the mercy seat, 
02037008	one cherub on one end and one on the other, all made from one piece of gold. 
02037009	And the cherubim had wings that spread upward, overshadowing the mercy seat. The cherubim faced each other, looking toward the mercy seat. 
02037010	He also made the table of acacia wood two cubits long, a cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high. 
02037011	He overlaid it with pure gold and made a gold molding around it. 
02037012	And he made a rim around it a handbreadth wide and put a gold molding on the rim. 
02037013	He cast four gold rings for the table and fastened them to the four corners at its four legs. 
02037014	The rings were placed close to the rim, to serve as holders for the poles used to carry the table. 
02037015	He made the poles of acacia wood for carrying the table and overlaid them with gold. 
02037016	He also made the utensils for the table out of pure gold: its plates and dishes, as well as its bowls and pitchers for pouring drink offerings. 
02037017	Then he made the lampstand out of pure hammered gold, all of one piece: its base and shaft, its cups, and its buds and petals. 
02037018	Six branches extended from the sides, three on one side and three on the other. 
02037019	There were three cups shaped like almond blossoms on the first branch, each with buds and petals, three on the next branch, and the same for all six branches that extended from the lampstand. 
02037020	And on the lampstand were four cups shaped like almond blossoms with buds and petals. 
02037021	A bud was under the first pair of branches that extended from the lampstand, a bud under the second pair, and a bud under the third pair. 
02037022	The buds and branches were all of one piece with the lampstand, hammered out of pure gold. 
02037023	He also made its seven lamps, its wick trimmers, and trays of pure gold. 
02037024	He made the lampstand and all its utensils from a talent of pure gold. 
02037025	He made the altar of incense out of acacia wood. It was square, a cubit long, a cubit wide, and two cubits high. Its horns were of one piece. 
02037026	And he overlaid with pure gold the top and all the sides and horns. Then he made a molding of gold around it. 
02037027	He made two gold rings below the molding on opposite sides to hold the poles used to carry it. 
02037028	And he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 
02037029	He also made the sacred anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense, the work of a perfumer. 
02038001	Bezalel constructed the altar of burnt offering from acacia wood. It was square, five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high. 
02038002	He made a horn at each of its four corners, so that the horns and altar were of one piece, and he overlaid the altar with bronze. 
02038003	He made all the altar’s utensils of bronze—its pots, shovels, sprinkling bowls, meat forks, and firepans. 
02038004	He made a grate of bronze mesh for the altar under its ledge, halfway up from the bottom. 
02038005	At the four corners of the bronze grate he cast four rings as holders for the poles. 
02038006	And he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze. 
02038007	Then he inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar for carrying it. He made the altar with boards so that it was hollow. 
02038008	Next he made the bronze basin and its stand from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 
02038009	Then he constructed the courtyard. The south side of the courtyard was a hundred cubits long and had curtains of finely spun linen, 
02038010	with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, and with silver hooks and bands on the posts. 
02038011	The north side was also a hundred cubits long, with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases. The hooks and bands of the posts were silver. 
02038012	The west side was fifty cubits long and had curtains, with ten posts and ten bases. The hooks and bands of the posts were silver. 
02038013	And the east side, toward the sunrise, was also fifty cubits long. 
02038014	The curtains on one side of the entrance were fifteen cubits long, with three posts and three bases. 
02038015	And the curtains on the other side were also fifteen cubits long, with three posts and three bases as well. 
02038016	All the curtains around the courtyard were made of finely spun linen. 
02038017	The bases for the posts were bronze, the hooks and bands were silver, and the plating for the tops of the posts was silver. So all the posts of the courtyard were banded with silver. 
02038018	The curtain for the entrance to the courtyard was embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen. It was twenty cubits long and, like the curtains of the courtyard, five cubits high, 
02038019	with four posts and four bronze bases. Their hooks were silver, as well as the bands and the plating of their tops. 
02038020	All the tent pegs for the tabernacle and for the surrounding courtyard were bronze. 
02038021	This is the inventory for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the Testimony, as recorded at Moses’ command by the Levites under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest. 
02038022	Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made everything that the LORD had commanded Moses. 
02038023	With him was Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, designer, and embroiderer in blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen. 
02038024	All the gold from the wave offering used for the work on the sanctuary totaled 29 talents and 730 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel. 
02038025	The silver from those numbered among the congregation totaled 100 talents and 1,775 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel— 
02038026	a beka per person, that is, half a shekel, according to the sanctuary shekel, from everyone twenty years of age or older who had crossed over to be numbered, a total of 603,550 men. 
02038027	The hundred talents of silver were used to cast the bases of the sanctuary and the bases of the veil—100 bases from the 100 talents, one talent per base. 
02038028	With the 1,775 shekels of silver he made the hooks for the posts, overlaid their tops, and supplied bands for them. 
02038029	The bronze from the wave offering totaled 70 talents and 2,400 shekels. 
02038030	He used it to make the bases for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the bronze altar and its bronze grating, all the utensils for the altar, 
02038031	the bases for the surrounding courtyard and its gate, and all the tent pegs for the tabernacle and its surrounding courtyard. 
02039001	From the blue, purple, and scarlet yarn they made specially woven garments for ministry in the sanctuary, as well as the holy garments for Aaron, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
02039002	Bezalel made the ephod of finely spun linen embroidered with gold, and with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn. 
02039003	They hammered out thin sheets of gold and cut threads from them to interweave with the blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine linen—the work of a skilled craftsman. 
02039004	They made shoulder pieces for the ephod, which were attached at two of its corners, so it could be fastened. 
02039005	And the skillfully woven waistband of the ephod was of one piece with the ephod, of the same workmanship—with gold, with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and with finely spun linen, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
02039006	They mounted the onyx stones in gold filigree settings, engraved like a seal with the names of the sons of Israel. 
02039007	Then they fastened them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
02039008	He made the breastpiece with the same workmanship as the ephod, with gold, with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and with finely spun linen. 
02039009	It was square when folded over double, a span long and a span wide. 
02039010	And they mounted on it four rows of gemstones: The first row had a ruby, a topaz, and an emerald; 
02039011	the second row had a turquoise, a sapphire, and a diamond; 
02039012	the third row had a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; 
02039013	and the fourth row had a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. These stones were mounted in gold filigree settings. 
02039014	The twelve stones corresponded to the names of the sons of Israel. Each stone was engraved like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes. 
02039015	For the breastpiece they made braided chains like cords of pure gold. 
02039016	They also made two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and fastened the two rings to the two corners of the breastpiece. 
02039017	Then they fastened the two gold chains to the two gold rings at the corners of the breastpiece, 
02039018	and they fastened the other ends of the two chains to the two filigree settings, attaching them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front. 
02039019	They made two more gold rings and attached them to the other two corners of the breastpiece, on the inside edge next to the ephod. 
02039020	They made two additional gold rings and attached them to the bottom of the two shoulder pieces of the ephod, on its front, near the seam just above its woven waistband. 
02039021	Then they tied the rings of the breastpiece to the rings of the ephod with a cord of blue yarn, so that the breastpiece was above the waistband of the ephod and would not swing out from the ephod, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
02039022	They made the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloth, the work of a weaver, 
02039023	with an opening in the center of the robe like that of a garment, with a collar around the opening so that it would not tear. 
02039024	They made pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and finely spun linen on the lower hem of the robe. 
02039025	They also made bells of pure gold and attached them around the hem between the pomegranates, 
02039026	alternating the bells and pomegranates around the lower hem of the robe to be worn for ministry, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
02039027	For Aaron and his sons they made tunics of fine linen, the work of a weaver, 
02039028	as well as the turban of fine linen, the ornate headbands and undergarments of finely spun linen, 
02039029	and the sash of finely spun linen, embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
02039030	They also made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and they engraved on it, like an inscription on a seal: HOLY TO THE LORD. 
02039031	Then they fastened to it a blue cord to mount it on the turban, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
02039032	So all the work for the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, was completed. The Israelites did everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
02039033	Then they brought the tabernacle to Moses: the tent with all its furnishings, its clasps, its frames, its crossbars, and its posts and bases; 
02039034	the covering of ram skins dyed red, the covering of fine leather, and the veil of the covering; 
02039035	the ark of the Testimony with its poles and the mercy seat; 
02039036	the table with all its utensils and the Bread of the Presence; 
02039037	the pure gold lampstand with its row of lamps and all its utensils, as well as the oil for the light; 
02039038	the gold altar, the anointing oil, the fragrant incense, and the curtain for the entrance to the tent; 
02039039	the bronze altar with its bronze grating, its poles, and all its utensils; the basin with its stand; 
02039040	the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases; the curtain for the gate of the courtyard, its ropes and tent pegs, and all the equipment for the service of the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting; 
02039041	and the woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary, both the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons to serve as priests. 
02039042	The Israelites had done all the work just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
02039043	And Moses inspected all the work and saw that they had accomplished it just as the LORD had commanded. So Moses blessed them. 
02040001	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
02040002	“On the first day of the first month you are to set up the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting. 
02040003	Put the ark of the Testimony in it and screen off the ark with the veil. 
02040004	Then bring in the table and set out its arrangement; bring in the lampstand as well, and set up its lamps. 
02040005	Place the gold altar of incense in front of the ark of the Testimony, and hang the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle. 
02040006	Place the altar of burnt offering in front of the entrance to the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting. 
02040007	And place the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water in it. 
02040008	Set up the surrounding courtyard and hang the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard. 
02040009	Take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and everything in it; consecrate it along with all its furnishings, and it shall be holy. 
02040010	Anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils; consecrate the altar, and it shall be most holy. 
02040011	Anoint the basin and its stand and consecrate them. 
02040012	Then bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and wash them with water. 
02040013	And you are to clothe Aaron with the holy garments, anoint him, and consecrate him, so that he may serve Me as a priest. 
02040014	Bring his sons forward and clothe them with tunics. 
02040015	Anoint them just as you anointed their father, so that they may also serve Me as priests. Their anointing will qualify them for a permanent priesthood throughout their generations.” 
02040016	Moses did everything just as the LORD had commanded him. 
02040017	So the tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month of the second year. 
02040018	When Moses set up the tabernacle, he laid its bases, positioned its frames, inserted its crossbars, and set up its posts. 
02040019	Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering over the tent, just as the LORD had commanded him. 
02040020	Moses took the Testimony and placed it in the ark, attaching the poles to the ark; and he set the mercy seat atop the ark. 
02040021	Then he brought the ark into the tabernacle, put up the veil for the screen, and shielded off the ark of the Testimony, just as the LORD had commanded him. 
02040022	Moses placed the table in the Tent of Meeting on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil. 
02040023	He arranged the bread on it before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded him. 
02040024	He also placed the lampstand in the Tent of Meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle 
02040025	and set up the lamps before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded him. 
02040026	Moses placed the gold altar in the Tent of Meeting, in front of the veil, 
02040027	and he burned fragrant incense on it, just as the LORD had commanded him. 
02040028	Then he put up the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle. 
02040029	He placed the altar of burnt offering near the entrance to the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the grain offering, just as the LORD had commanded him. 
02040030	He placed the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing; 
02040031	and from it Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and feet. 
02040032	They washed whenever they entered the Tent of Meeting or approached the altar, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
02040033	And Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and the altar, and he hung the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard. So Moses finished the work. 
02040034	Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. 
02040035	Moses was unable to enter the Tent of Meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. 
02040036	Whenever the cloud was lifted from above the tabernacle, the Israelites would set out through all the stages of their journey. 
02040037	If the cloud was not lifted, they would not set out until the day it was taken up. 
02040038	For the cloud of the LORD was over the tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel through all their journeys. 
03001001	Then the LORD called to Moses and spoke to him from the Tent of Meeting, saying, 
03001002	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When any of you brings an offering to the LORD, you may bring as your offering an animal from the herd or the flock. 
03001003	If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he is to present an unblemished male. He must bring it to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting for its acceptance before the LORD. 
03001004	He is to lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, so it can be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for him. 
03001005	And he shall slaughter the young bull before the LORD, and Aaron’s sons the priests are to present the blood and splatter it on all sides of the altar at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 
03001006	Next, he is to skin the burnt offering and cut it into pieces. 
03001007	The sons of Aaron the priest shall put a fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire. 
03001008	Then Aaron’s sons the priests are to arrange the pieces, including the head and the fat, atop the burning wood on the altar. 
03001009	The entrails and legs must be washed with water, and the priest shall burn all of it on the altar as a burnt offering, a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. 
03001010	If, however, one’s offering is a burnt offering from the flock—from the sheep or goats—he is to present an unblemished male. 
03001011	He shall slaughter it on the north side of the altar before the LORD, and Aaron’s sons the priests are to splatter its blood against the altar on all sides. 
03001012	He is to cut the animal into pieces, and the priest shall arrange them, including the head and fat, atop the burning wood that is on the altar. 
03001013	The entrails and legs must be washed with water, and the priest shall present all of it and burn it on the altar; it is a burnt offering, a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. 
03001014	If, instead, one’s offering to the LORD is a burnt offering of birds, he is to present a turtledove or a young pigeon. 
03001015	Then the priest shall bring it to the altar, twist off its head, and burn it on the altar; its blood should be drained out on the side of the altar. 
03001016	And he is to remove the crop with its contents and throw it to the east side of the altar, in the place for ashes. 
03001017	He shall tear it open by its wings, without dividing the bird completely. And the priest is to burn it on the altar atop the burning wood. It is a burnt offering, a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. 
03002001	“When anyone brings a grain offering to the LORD, his offering must consist of fine flour. He is to pour olive oil on it, put frankincense on it, 
03002002	and bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests. The priest shall take a handful of the flour and oil, together with all the frankincense, and burn this as a memorial portion on the altar, a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. 
03002003	The remainder of the grain offering shall belong to Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the food offerings to the LORD. 
03002004	Now if you bring an offering of grain baked in an oven, it must consist of fine flour, either unleavened cakes mixed with oil or unleavened wafers coated with oil. 
03002005	If your offering is a grain offering prepared on a griddle, it must be unleavened bread made of fine flour mixed with oil. 
03002006	Crumble it and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering. 
03002007	If your offering is a grain offering cooked in a pan, it must consist of fine flour with oil. 
03002008	When you bring to the LORD the grain offering made in any of these ways, it is to be presented to the priest, and he shall take it to the altar. 
03002009	The priest is to remove the memorial portion from the grain offering and burn it on the altar as a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. 
03002010	But the remainder of the grain offering shall belong to Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the food offerings to the LORD. 
03002011	No grain offering that you present to the LORD may be made with leaven, for you are not to burn any leaven or honey as a food offering to the LORD. 
03002012	You may bring them to the LORD as an offering of firstfruits, but they must not go up on the altar as a pleasing aroma. 
03002013	And you shall season each of your grain offerings with salt. You must not leave the salt of the covenant of your God out of your grain offering; you are to add salt to each of your offerings. 
03002014	If you bring a grain offering of firstfruits to the LORD, you shall offer crushed heads of new grain roasted on the fire. 
03002015	And you are to put oil and frankincense on it; it is a grain offering. 
03002016	The priest shall then burn the memorial portion of the crushed grain and the oil, together with all its frankincense, as a food offering to the LORD. 
03003001	“If one’s offering is a peace offering and he offers an animal from the herd, whether male or female, he must present it without blemish before the LORD. 
03003002	He is to lay his hand on the head of the offering and slaughter it at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. Then Aaron’s sons the priests shall splatter the blood on all sides of the altar. 
03003003	From the peace offering he is to bring a food offering to the LORD: the fat that covers the entrails, all the fat that is on them, 
03003004	both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he is to remove with the kidneys. 
03003005	Then Aaron’s sons are to burn it on the altar atop the burnt offering that is on the burning wood, as a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. 
03003006	If, however, one’s peace offering to the LORD is from the flock, he must present a male or female without blemish. 
03003007	If he is presenting a lamb for his offering, he must present it before the LORD. 
03003008	He is to lay his hand on the head of his offering and slaughter it in front of the Tent of Meeting. Then Aaron’s sons shall splatter its blood on all sides of the altar. 
03003009	And from the peace offering he shall bring a food offering to the LORD consisting of its fat: the entire fat tail cut off close to the backbone, the fat that covers the entrails, all the fat that is on them, 
03003010	both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he is to remove with the kidneys. 
03003011	Then the priest is to burn them on the altar as food, a food offering to the LORD. 
03003012	If one’s offering is a goat, he is to present it before the LORD. 
03003013	He must lay his hand on its head and slaughter it in front of the Tent of Meeting. Then Aaron’s sons shall splatter its blood on all sides of the altar. 
03003014	And from his offering he shall present a food offering to the LORD: the fat that covers the entrails, all the fat that is on them, 
03003015	both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he is to remove with the kidneys. 
03003016	Then the priest is to burn the food on the altar as a food offering, a pleasing aroma. All the fat is the LORD’s. 
03003017	This is a permanent statute for the generations to come, wherever you live: You must not eat any fat or any blood.” 
03004001	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
03004002	“Tell the Israelites to do as follows with one who sins unintentionally against any of the LORD’s commandments and does what is forbidden by them: 
03004003	If the anointed priest sins, bringing guilt on the people, he must bring to the LORD a young bull without blemish as a sin offering for the sin he has committed. 
03004004	He must bring the bull to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting before the LORD, lay his hand on the bull’s head, and slaughter it before the LORD. 
03004005	Then the anointed priest shall take some of the bull’s blood and bring it into the Tent of Meeting. 
03004006	The priest is to dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of it seven times before the LORD, in front of the veil of the sanctuary. 
03004007	The priest must then put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense that is before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting. And he is to pour out the rest of the bull’s blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 
03004008	Then he shall remove all the fat from the bull of the sin offering—the fat that covers the entrails, all the fat that is on them, 
03004009	both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he is to remove with the kidneys— 
03004010	just as the fat is removed from the ox of the peace offering. Then the priest shall burn them on the altar of burnt offering. 
03004011	But the hide of the bull and all its flesh, with its head and legs and its entrails and dung— 
03004012	all the rest of the bull—he must take outside the camp to a ceremonially clean place where the ashes are poured out, and there he must burn it on a wood fire on the ash heap. 
03004013	Now if the whole congregation of Israel strays unintentionally and the matter escapes the notice of the assembly so that they violate any of the LORD’s commandments and incur guilt by doing what is forbidden, 
03004014	when they become aware of the sin they have committed, then the assembly must bring a young bull as a sin offering and present it before the Tent of Meeting. 
03004015	The elders of the congregation are to lay their hands on the bull’s head before the LORD, and it shall be slaughtered before the LORD. 
03004016	Then the anointed priest is to bring some of the bull’s blood into the Tent of Meeting, 
03004017	and he is to dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD in front of the veil. 
03004018	He is also to put some of the blood on the horns of the altar that is before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting, and he must pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 
03004019	And he is to remove all the fat from it and burn it on the altar. 
03004020	He shall offer this bull just as he did the bull for the sin offering; in this way the priest will make atonement on their behalf, and they will be forgiven. 
03004021	Then he is to take the bull outside the camp and burn it, just as he burned the first bull. It is the sin offering for the assembly. 
03004022	When a leader sins unintentionally and does what is prohibited by any of the commandments of the LORD his God, he incurs guilt. 
03004023	When he becomes aware of the sin he has committed, he must bring an unblemished male goat as his offering. 
03004024	He is to lay his hand on the head of the goat and slaughter it at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered before the LORD. It is a sin offering. 
03004025	Then the priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. 
03004026	He must burn all its fat on the altar, like the fat of the peace offerings; thus the priest will make atonement for that man’s sin, and he will be forgiven. 
03004027	And if one of the common people sins unintentionally and does what is prohibited by any of the LORD’s commandments, he incurs guilt. 
03004028	When he becomes aware of the sin he has committed, he must bring an unblemished female goat as his offering for that sin. 
03004029	He is to lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it at the place of the burnt offering. 
03004030	Then the priest is to take some of its blood with his finger, put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. 
03004031	Then he is to remove all the fat, just as it is removed from the peace offering, and the priest is to burn it on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the LORD. In this way the priest will make atonement for him, and he will be forgiven. 
03004032	If, however, he brings a lamb as a sin offering, he must bring an unblemished female. 
03004033	And he is to lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it as a sin offering at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered. 
03004034	Then the priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar. 
03004035	And he shall remove all the fat, just as the fat of the lamb is removed from the peace offerings, and he shall burn it on the altar along with the food offerings to the LORD. In this way the priest will make atonement for him for the sin he has committed, and he will be forgiven. 
03005001	“If someone sins by failing to testify when he hears a public charge about something he has witnessed, whether he has seen it or learned of it, he shall bear the iniquity. 
03005002	Or if a person touches anything unclean—whether the carcass of any unclean wild animal or livestock or crawling creature—even if he is unaware of it, he is unclean and guilty. 
03005003	Or if he touches human uncleanness—anything by which one becomes unclean—even if he is unaware of it, when he realizes it, he is guilty. 
03005004	Or if someone swears thoughtlessly with his lips to do anything good or evil—in whatever matter a man may rashly pronounce an oath—even if he is unaware of it, when he realizes it, he is guilty in the matter. 
03005005	If someone incurs guilt in one of these ways, he must confess the sin he has committed, 
03005006	and he must bring his guilt offering to the LORD for the sin he has committed: a female lamb or goat from the flock as a sin offering. And the priest will make atonement for him concerning his sin. 
03005007	If, however, he cannot afford a lamb, he may bring to the LORD as restitution for his sin two turtledoves or two young pigeons—one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. 
03005008	He is to bring them to the priest, who shall first present the one for the sin offering. He is to twist its head at the front of its neck without severing it; 
03005009	then he is to sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, while the rest of the blood is drained out at the base of the altar. It is a sin offering. 
03005010	And the priest must prepare the second bird as a burnt offering according to the ordinance. In this way the priest will make atonement for him for the sin he has committed, and he will be forgiven. 
03005011	But if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons, he may bring a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a sin offering. He must not put olive oil or frankincense on it, because it is a sin offering. 
03005012	He is to bring it to the priest, who shall take a handful from it as a memorial portion and burn it on the altar atop the food offerings to the LORD; it is a sin offering. 
03005013	In this way the priest will make atonement for him for any of these sins he has committed, and he will be forgiven. The remainder will belong to the priest, like the grain offering.” 
03005014	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
03005015	“If someone acts unfaithfully and sins unintentionally against any of the LORD’s holy things, he must bring his guilt offering to the LORD: an unblemished ram from the flock, of proper value in silver shekels according to the sanctuary shekel; it is a guilt offering. 
03005016	Regarding any holy thing he has harmed, he must make restitution by adding a fifth of its value to it and giving it to the priest, who will make atonement on his behalf with the ram as a guilt offering, and he will be forgiven. 
03005017	If someone sins and violates any of the LORD’s commandments even though he was unaware, he is guilty and shall bear his punishment. 
03005018	He is to bring to the priest an unblemished ram of proper value from the flock as a guilt offering. Then the priest will make atonement on his behalf for the wrong he has committed in ignorance, and he will be forgiven. 
03005019	It is a guilt offering; he was certainly guilty before the LORD.” 
03006001	And the LORD said to Moses, 
03006002	“If someone sins and acts unfaithfully against the LORD by deceiving his neighbor in regard to a deposit or security entrusted to him or stolen, or if he extorts his neighbor 
03006003	or finds lost property and lies about it and swears falsely, or if he commits any such sin that a man might commit— 
03006004	once he has sinned and becomes guilty, he must return what he has stolen or taken by extortion, or the deposit entrusted to him, or the lost property he found, 
03006005	or anything else about which he has sworn falsely. He must make restitution in full, add a fifth of the value, and pay it to the owner on the day he acknowledges his guilt. 
03006006	Then he must bring to the priest his guilt offering to the LORD: an unblemished ram of proper value from the flock. 
03006007	In this way the priest will make atonement for him before the LORD, and he will be forgiven for anything he may have done to incur guilt.” 
03006008	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
03006009	“Command Aaron and his sons that this is the law of the burnt offering: The burnt offering is to remain on the hearth of the altar all night, until morning, and the fire must be kept burning on the altar. 
03006010	And the priest shall put on his linen robe and linen undergarments, and he shall remove from the altar the ashes of the burnt offering that the fire has consumed and place them beside it. 
03006011	Then he must take off his garments, put on other clothes, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a ceremonially clean place. 
03006012	The fire on the altar shall be kept burning; it must not be extinguished. Every morning the priest is to add wood to the fire, arrange the burnt offering on it, and burn the fat portions of the peace offerings on it. 
03006013	The fire shall be kept burning on the altar continually; it must not be extinguished. 
03006014	Now this is the law of the grain offering: Aaron’s sons shall present it before the LORD in front of the altar. 
03006015	The priest is to remove a handful of fine flour and olive oil, together with all the frankincense from the grain offering, and burn the memorial portion on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the LORD. 
03006016	Aaron and his sons are to eat the remainder. It must be eaten without leaven in a holy place; they are to eat it in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting. 
03006017	It must not be baked with leaven; I have assigned it as their portion of My food offerings. It is most holy, like the sin offering and the guilt offering. 
03006018	Any male among the sons of Aaron may eat it. This is a permanent portion from the food offerings to the LORD for the generations to come. Anything that touches them will become holy.” 
03006019	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
03006020	“This is the offering that Aaron and his sons must present to the LORD on the day he is anointed: a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half in the evening. 
03006021	It shall be prepared with oil on a griddle; you are to bring it well-kneaded and present it as a grain offering broken in pieces, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. 
03006022	The priest, who is one of Aaron’s sons and will be anointed to take his place, is to prepare it. As a permanent portion for the LORD, it must be burned completely. 
03006023	Every grain offering for a priest shall be burned completely; it is not to be eaten.” 
03006024	And the LORD said to Moses, 
03006025	“Tell Aaron and his sons that this is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, the sin offering shall be slaughtered before the LORD; it is most holy. 
03006026	The priest who offers it shall eat it; it must be eaten in a holy place, in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting. 
03006027	Anything that touches its flesh will become holy, and if any of the blood is spattered on a garment, you must wash it in a holy place. 
03006028	The clay pot in which the sin offering is boiled must be broken; if it is boiled in a bronze pot, the pot must be scoured and rinsed with water. 
03006029	Any male among the priests may eat it; it is most holy. 
03006030	But no sin offering may be eaten if its blood has been brought into the Tent of Meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place; it must be burned. 
03007001	“Now this is the law of the guilt offering, which is most holy: 
03007002	The guilt offering must be slaughtered in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, and the priest shall splatter its blood on all sides of the altar. 
03007003	And all the fat from it shall be offered: the fat tail, the fat that covers the entrails, 
03007004	both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which is to be removed with the kidneys. 
03007005	The priest shall burn them on the altar as a food offering to the LORD; it is a guilt offering. 
03007006	Every male among the priests may eat of it. It must be eaten in a holy place; it is most holy. 
03007007	The guilt offering is like the sin offering; the same law applies to both. It belongs to the priest who makes atonement with it. 
03007008	As for the priest who presents a burnt offering for anyone, the hide of that offering belongs to him. 
03007009	Likewise, every grain offering that is baked in an oven or cooked in a pan or on a griddle belongs to the priest who presents it, 
03007010	and every grain offering, whether dry or mixed with oil, belongs equally to all the sons of Aaron. 
03007011	Now this is the law of the peace offering that one may present to the LORD: 
03007012	If he offers it in thanksgiving, then along with the sacrifice of thanksgiving he shall offer unleavened cakes mixed with olive oil, unleavened wafers coated with oil, and well-kneaded cakes of fine flour mixed with oil. 
03007013	Along with his peace offering of thanksgiving he is to present an offering with cakes of leavened bread. 
03007014	From the cakes he must present one portion of each offering as a contribution to the LORD. It belongs to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offering. 
03007015	The meat of the sacrifice of his peace offering of thanksgiving must be eaten on the day he offers it; none of it may be left until morning. 
03007016	If, however, the sacrifice he offers is a vow or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day he presents his sacrifice, but the remainder may be eaten on the next day. 
03007017	But any meat of the sacrifice remaining until the third day must be burned up. 
03007018	If any of the meat from his peace offering is eaten on the third day, it will not be accepted. It will not be credited to the one who presented it; it shall be an abomination, and the one who eats of it shall bear his iniquity. 
03007019	Meat that touches anything unclean must not be eaten; it is to be burned up. As for any other meat, anyone who is ceremonially clean may eat it. 
03007020	But if anyone who is unclean eats meat from the peace offering that belongs to the LORD, that person must be cut off from his people. 
03007021	If one touches anything unclean, whether human uncleanness, an unclean animal, or any unclean, detestable thing, and then eats any of the meat of the peace offering that belongs to the LORD, that person must be cut off from his people.” 
03007022	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
03007023	“Speak to the Israelites and say, ‘You are not to eat any of the fat of an ox, a sheep, or a goat. 
03007024	The fat of an animal found dead or mauled by wild beasts may be used for any other purpose, but you must not eat it. 
03007025	If anyone eats the fat of an animal from which a food offering may be presented to the LORD, the one who eats it must be cut off from his people. 
03007026	You must not eat the blood of any bird or animal in any of your dwellings. 
03007027	If anyone eats blood, that person must be cut off from his people.’” 
03007028	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
03007029	“Speak to the Israelites and say, ‘Anyone who presents a peace offering to the LORD must bring it as his sacrifice to the LORD. 
03007030	With his own hands he is to bring the food offerings to the LORD; he shall bring the fat, together with the breast, and wave the breast as a wave offering before the LORD. 
03007031	The priest is to burn the fat on the altar, but the breast belongs to Aaron and his sons. 
03007032	And you are to give the right thigh to the priest as a contribution from your peace offering. 
03007033	The son of Aaron who presents the blood and fat of the peace offering shall have the right thigh as a portion. 
03007034	I have taken from the sons of Israel the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution of their peace offerings, and I have given them to Aaron the priest and his sons as a permanent portion from the sons of Israel.’” 
03007035	This is the portion of the food offerings to the LORD for Aaron and his sons since the day they were presented to serve the LORD as priests. 
03007036	On the day they were anointed, the LORD commanded that this be given them by the sons of Israel. It is a permanent portion for the generations to come. 
03007037	This is the law of the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the guilt offering, the ordination offering, and the peace offering, 
03007038	which the LORD gave Moses on Mount Sinai on the day He commanded the Israelites to present their offerings to the LORD in the Wilderness of Sinai. 
03008001	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
03008002	“Take Aaron and his sons, their garments, the anointing oil, the bull of the sin offering, the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread, 
03008003	and assemble the whole congregation at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.” 
03008004	So Moses did as the LORD had commanded him, and the assembly gathered at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 
03008005	And Moses said to them, “This is what the LORD has commanded to be done.” 
03008006	Then Moses presented Aaron and his sons and washed them with water. 
03008007	He put the tunic on Aaron, tied the sash around him, clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod on him. He tied the woven band of the ephod around him and fastened it to him. 
03008008	Then he put the breastpiece on him and placed the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece. 
03008009	Moses also put the turban on Aaron’s head and set the gold plate, the holy diadem, on the front of the turban, as the LORD had commanded him. 
03008010	Next, Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it; and so he consecrated them. 
03008011	He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times, anointing the altar and all its utensils, and the basin with its stand, to consecrate them. 
03008012	He also poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him to consecrate him. 
03008013	Then Moses presented Aaron’s sons, put tunics on them, wrapped sashes around them, and tied headbands on them, just as the LORD had commanded him. 
03008014	Moses then brought the bull near for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. 
03008015	Moses slaughtered the bull, took some of the blood, and applied it with his finger to all four horns of the altar, purifying the altar. He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar and consecrated it so that atonement could be made on it. 
03008016	Moses also took all the fat that was on the entrails, the lobe of the liver, and both kidneys and their fat, and burned it all on the altar. 
03008017	But the bull with its hide, flesh, and dung he burned outside the camp, as the LORD had commanded him. 
03008018	Then Moses presented the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. 
03008019	Moses slaughtered the ram and splattered the blood on all sides of the altar. 
03008020	He cut the ram into pieces and burned the head, the pieces, and the fat. 
03008021	He washed the entrails and legs with water and burned the entire ram on the altar as a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, a food offering to the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
03008022	After that, Moses presented the other ram, the ram of ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. 
03008023	Moses slaughtered the ram and took some of its blood and put it on Aaron’s right earlobe, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. 
03008024	Moses also presented Aaron’s sons and put some of the blood on their right earlobes, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. Then he splattered the blood on all sides of the altar. 
03008025	And Moses took the fat—the fat tail, all the fat that was on the entrails, the lobe of the liver, and both kidneys with their fat—as well as the right thigh. 
03008026	And from the basket of unleavened bread that was before the LORD, he took one cake of unleavened bread, one cake of bread made with oil, and one wafer, and he placed them on the fat portions and on the right thigh. 
03008027	He put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons and waved them before the LORD as a wave offering. 
03008028	Then Moses took these from their hands and burned them on the altar with the burnt offering. This was an ordination offering, a pleasing aroma, a food offering to the LORD. 
03008029	He also took the breast—Moses’ portion of the ram of ordination—and waved it before the LORD as a wave offering, as the LORD had commanded him. 
03008030	Next, Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled them on Aaron and his garments, and on his sons and their garments. So he consecrated Aaron and his garments, as well as Aaron’s sons and their garments. 
03008031	And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, “Boil the meat at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket of ordination offerings, as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons are to eat it.’ 
03008032	Then you must burn up the remainder of the meat and bread. 
03008033	You must not go outside the entrance to the Tent of Meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are complete; for it will take seven days to ordain you. 
03008034	What has been done today has been commanded by the LORD in order to make atonement on your behalf. 
03008035	You must remain at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting day and night for seven days and keep the LORD’s charge so that you will not die, for this is what I have been commanded.” 
03008036	So Aaron and his sons did everything the LORD had commanded through Moses. 
03009001	On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel. 
03009002	He said to Aaron, “Take for yourself a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, both without blemish, and present them before the LORD. 
03009003	Then speak to the Israelites and say, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering, a calf and a lamb—both a year old and without blemish—for a burnt offering, 
03009004	an ox and a ram for a peace offering to sacrifice before the LORD, and a grain offering mixed with oil. For today the LORD will appear to you.’” 
03009005	So they took what Moses had commanded to the front of the Tent of Meeting, and the whole congregation drew near and stood before the LORD. 
03009006	And Moses said, “This is what the LORD has commanded you to do, so that the glory of the LORD may appear to you.” 
03009007	Then Moses said to Aaron, “Approach the altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering to make atonement for yourself and for the people. And sacrifice the people’s offering to make atonement for them, as the LORD has commanded.” 
03009008	So Aaron approached the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for himself. 
03009009	The sons of Aaron brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and applied it to the horns of the altar. And he poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. 
03009010	On the altar he burned the fat, the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver from the sin offering, as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
03009011	But he burned up the flesh and the hide outside the camp. 
03009012	Then Aaron slaughtered the burnt offering. His sons brought him the blood, and he splattered it on all sides of the altar. 
03009013	They brought him the burnt offering piece by piece, including the head, and he burned them on the altar. 
03009014	He washed the entrails and the legs and burned them atop the burnt offering on the altar. 
03009015	Aaron then presented the people’s offering. He took the male goat for the people’s sin offering, slaughtered it, and offered it for sin like the first one. 
03009016	He presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the ordinance. 
03009017	Next he presented the grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar in addition to the morning’s burnt offering. 
03009018	Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram as the people’s peace offering. His sons brought him the blood, and he splattered it on all sides of the altar. 
03009019	They also brought the fat portions from the ox and the ram—the fat tail, the fat covering the entrails, the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver— 
03009020	and placed these on the breasts. Aaron burned the fat portions on the altar, 
03009021	but he waved the breasts and the right thigh as a wave offering before the LORD, as Moses had commanded. 
03009022	Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them. And having made the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offering, he stepped down. 
03009023	Moses and Aaron then entered the Tent of Meeting. When they came out, they blessed the people, and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people. 
03009024	Fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar. And when all the people saw it, they shouted for joy and fell facedown. 
03010001	Now Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu took their censers, put fire in them and added incense, and offered unauthorized fire before the LORD, contrary to His command. 
03010002	So fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed them, and they died in the presence of the LORD. 
03010003	Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the LORD meant when He said: ‘To those who come near Me I will show My holiness, and in the sight of all the people I will reveal My glory.’” But Aaron remained silent. 
03010004	Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, and said to them, “Come here; carry the bodies of your cousins outside the camp, away from the front of the sanctuary.” 
03010005	So they came forward and carried them, still in their tunics, outside the camp, as Moses had directed. 
03010006	Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not let your hair become disheveled and do not tear your garments, or else you will die, and the LORD will be angry with the whole congregation. But your brothers, the whole house of Israel, may mourn on account of the fire that the LORD has ignited. 
03010007	You shall not go outside the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, or you will die, for the LORD’s anointing oil is on you.” So they did as Moses instructed. 
03010008	Then the LORD said to Aaron, 
03010009	“You and your sons are not to drink wine or strong drink when you enter the Tent of Meeting, or else you will die; this is a permanent statute for the generations to come. 
03010010	You must distinguish between the holy and the common, between the clean and the unclean, 
03010011	so that you may teach the Israelites all the statutes that the LORD has given them through Moses.” 
03010012	And Moses said to Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, “Take the grain offering that remains from the food offerings to the LORD and eat it without leaven beside the altar, because it is most holy. 
03010013	You shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your share and your sons’ share of the food offerings to the LORD; for this is what I have been commanded. 
03010014	And you and your sons and daughters may eat the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution in a ceremonially clean place, because these portions have been assigned to you and your children from the peace offerings of the sons of Israel. 
03010015	They are to bring the thigh of the contribution and the breast of the wave offering, together with the fat portions of the food offerings, to wave as a wave offering before the LORD. It will belong permanently to you and your children, as the LORD has commanded.” 
03010016	Later, Moses searched carefully for the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it had been burned up. He was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s remaining sons, and asked, 
03010017	“Why didn’t you eat the sin offering in the holy place? For it is most holy; it was given to you to take away the guilt of the congregation by making atonement for them before the LORD. 
03010018	Since its blood was not brought inside the holy place, you should have eaten it in the sanctuary area, as I commanded.” 
03010019	But Aaron replied to Moses, “Behold, this very day they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD. Since these things have happened to me, if I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been acceptable in the sight of the LORD?” 
03010020	And when Moses heard this explanation, he was satisfied. 
03011001	The LORD spoke again to Moses and Aaron, telling them, 
03011002	“Say to the Israelites, ‘Of all the beasts of the earth, these ones you may eat: 
03011003	You may eat any animal that has a split hoof completely divided and that chews the cud. 
03011004	But of those that only chew the cud or only have a divided hoof, you are not to eat the following: The camel, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean for you. 
03011005	The rock badger, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean for you. 
03011006	The rabbit, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean for you. 
03011007	And the pig, though it has a split hoof completely divided, does not chew the cud; it is unclean for you. 
03011008	You must not eat their meat or touch their carcasses; they are unclean for you. 
03011009	Of all the creatures that live in the water, whether in the seas or in the streams, you may eat anything with fins and scales. 
03011010	But the following among all the teeming life and creatures in the water are detestable to you: everything in the seas or streams that does not have fins and scales. 
03011011	They shall be an abomination to you; you must not eat their meat, and you must detest their carcasses. 
03011012	Everything in the water that does not have fins and scales shall be detestable to you. 
03011013	Additionally, you are to detest the following birds, and they must not be eaten because they are detestable: the eagle, the bearded vulture, the black vulture, 
03011014	the kite, any kind of falcon, 
03011015	any kind of raven, 
03011016	the ostrich, the screech owl, the gull, any kind of hawk, 
03011017	the little owl, the cormorant, the great owl, 
03011018	the white owl, the desert owl, the osprey, 
03011019	the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe, and the bat. 
03011020	All flying insects that walk on all fours are detestable to you. 
03011021	However, you may eat the following kinds of flying insects that walk on all fours: those having jointed legs above their feet for hopping on the ground. 
03011022	Of these you may eat any kind of locust, katydid, cricket, or grasshopper. 
03011023	All other flying insects that have four legs are detestable to you. 
03011024	These creatures will make you unclean. Whoever touches their carcasses will be unclean until evening, 
03011025	and whoever picks up one of their carcasses must wash his clothes, and he will be unclean until evening. 
03011026	Every animal with hooves not completely divided or that does not chew the cud is unclean for you. Whoever touches any of them will be unclean. 
03011027	All the four-footed animals that walk on their paws are unclean for you; whoever touches their carcasses will be unclean until evening, 
03011028	and anyone who picks up a carcass must wash his clothes, and he will be unclean until evening. They are unclean for you. 
03011029	The following creatures that move along the ground are unclean for you: the mole, the mouse, any kind of great lizard, 
03011030	the gecko, the monitor lizard, the common lizard, the skink, and the chameleon. 
03011031	These animals are unclean for you among all the crawling creatures. Whoever touches them when they are dead shall be unclean until evening. 
03011032	When one of them dies and falls on something, that article becomes unclean; any article of wood, clothing, leather, sackcloth, or any implement used for work must be rinsed with water and will remain unclean until evening; then it will be clean. 
03011033	If any of them falls into a clay pot, everything in it will be unclean; you must break the pot. 
03011034	Any food coming into contact with water from that pot will be unclean, and any drink in such a container will be unclean. 
03011035	Anything upon which one of their carcasses falls will be unclean. If it is an oven or cooking pot, it must be smashed; it is unclean and will remain unclean for you. 
03011036	Nevertheless, a spring or cistern containing water will remain clean, but one who touches a carcass in it will be unclean. 
03011037	If a carcass falls on any seed for sowing, the seed is clean; 
03011038	but if water has been put on the seed and a carcass falls on it, it is unclean for you. 
03011039	If an animal that you may eat dies, anyone who touches the carcass will be unclean until evening. 
03011040	Whoever eats from the carcass must wash his clothes and will be unclean until evening, and anyone who picks up the carcass must wash his clothes and will be unclean until evening. 
03011041	Every creature that moves along the ground is detestable; it must not be eaten. 
03011042	Do not eat any creature that moves along the ground, whether it crawls on its belly or walks on four or more feet; for such creatures are detestable. 
03011043	Do not defile yourselves by any crawling creature; do not become unclean or defiled by them. 
03011044	For I am the LORD your God; consecrate yourselves, therefore, and be holy, because I am holy. You must not defile yourselves by any creature that crawls along the ground. 
03011045	For I am the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt so that I would be your God; therefore be holy, because I am holy. 
03011046	This is the law regarding animals, birds, all living creatures that move in the water, and all creatures that crawl along the ground. 
03011047	You must distinguish between the unclean and the clean, between animals that may be eaten and those that may not.’” 
03012001	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
03012002	“Say to the Israelites, ‘A woman who becomes pregnant and gives birth to a son will be unclean for seven days, as she is during the days of her menstruation. 
03012003	And on the eighth day the flesh of the boy’s foreskin is to be circumcised. 
03012004	The woman shall continue in purification from her bleeding for thirty-three days. She must not touch anything sacred or go into the sanctuary until the days of her purification are complete. 
03012005	If, however, she gives birth to a daughter, the woman will be unclean for two weeks as she is during her menstruation. Then she must continue in purification from her bleeding for sixty-six days. 
03012006	When the days of her purification are complete, whether for a son or for a daughter, she is to bring to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting a year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering. 
03012007	And the priest will present them before the LORD and make atonement for her; and she shall be ceremonially cleansed from her flow of blood. This is the law for a woman giving birth, whether to a male or to a female. 
03012008	But if she cannot afford a lamb, she shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. Then the priest will make atonement for her, and she will be clean.’” 
03013001	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 
03013002	“When someone has a swelling or rash or bright spot on his skin that may be an infectious skin disease, he must be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons who is a priest. 
03013003	The priest is to examine the infection on his skin, and if the hair in the infection has turned white and the sore appears to be deeper than the skin, it is a skin disease. After the priest examines him, he must pronounce him unclean. 
03013004	If, however, the spot on his skin is white and does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and the hair in it has not turned white, the priest shall isolate the infected person for seven days. 
03013005	On the seventh day the priest is to reexamine him, and if he sees that the infection is unchanged and has not spread on the skin, the priest must isolate him for another seven days. 
03013006	The priest will examine him again on the seventh day, and if the sore has faded and has not spread on the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is a rash. The person must wash his clothes and be clean. 
03013007	But if the rash spreads further on his skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he must present himself again to the priest. 
03013008	The priest will reexamine him, and if the rash has spread on the skin, the priest must pronounce him unclean; it is a skin disease. 
03013009	When anyone develops a skin disease, he must be brought to the priest. 
03013010	The priest will examine him, and if there is a white swelling on the skin that has turned the hair white, and there is raw flesh in the swelling, 
03013011	it is a chronic skin disease and the priest must pronounce him unclean. He need not isolate him, for he is unclean. 
03013012	But if the skin disease breaks out all over his skin so that it covers all the skin of the infected person from head to foot, as far as the priest can see, 
03013013	the priest shall examine him, and if the disease has covered his entire body, he is to pronounce the infected person clean. Since it has all turned white, he is clean. 
03013014	But whenever raw flesh appears on someone, he will be unclean. 
03013015	When the priest sees the raw flesh, he must pronounce him unclean. The raw flesh is unclean; it is a skin disease. 
03013016	But if the raw flesh changes and turns white, he must go to the priest. 
03013017	The priest will reexamine him, and if the infection has turned white, the priest is to pronounce the infected person clean; then he is clean. 
03013018	When a boil appears on someone’s skin and it heals, 
03013019	and a white swelling or a reddish-white spot develops where the boil was, he must present himself to the priest. 
03013020	The priest shall examine it, and if it appears to be beneath the skin and the hair in it has turned white, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a diseased infection that has broken out in the boil. 
03013021	But when the priest examines it, if there is no white hair in it, and it is not beneath the skin and has faded, the priest shall isolate him for seven days. 
03013022	If it spreads any further on the skin, the priest must pronounce him unclean; it is an infection. 
03013023	But if the spot remains unchanged and does not spread, it is only the scar from the boil, and the priest shall pronounce him clean. 
03013024	When there is a burn on someone’s skin and the raw area of the burn becomes reddish-white or white, 
03013025	the priest must examine it. If the hair in the spot has turned white and the spot appears to be deeper than the skin, it is a disease that has broken out in the burn. The priest must pronounce him unclean; it is a diseased infection. 
03013026	But if the priest examines it and there is no white hair in the spot, and it is not beneath the skin but has faded, the priest shall isolate him for seven days. 
03013027	On the seventh day the priest is to reexamine him, and if it has spread further on the skin, the priest must pronounce him unclean; it is a diseased infection. 
03013028	But if the spot is unchanged and has not spread on the skin but has faded, it is a swelling from the burn, and the priest is to pronounce him clean; for it is only the scar from the burn. 
03013029	If a man or woman has an infection on the head or chin, 
03013030	the priest shall examine the infection, and if it appears to be deeper than the skin and the hair in it is yellow and thin, the priest must pronounce him unclean; it is a scaly outbreak, an infectious disease of the head or chin. 
03013031	But if the priest examines the scaly infection and it does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, the priest shall isolate the infected person for seven days. 
03013032	On the seventh day the priest is to reexamine the infection, and if the scaly outbreak has not spread and there is no yellow hair in it, and it does not appear to be deeper than the skin, 
03013033	then the person must shave himself except for the scaly area. Then the priest shall isolate him for another seven days. 
03013034	On the seventh day the priest shall examine the scaly outbreak, and if it has not spread on the skin and does not appear to be deeper than the skin, the priest is to pronounce him clean. He must wash his clothes, and he will be clean. 
03013035	If, however, the scaly outbreak spreads further on the skin after his cleansing, 
03013036	the priest is to examine him, and if the scaly outbreak has spread on the skin, the priest need not look for yellow hair; the person is unclean. 
03013037	If, however, in his sight the scaly outbreak is unchanged and black hair has grown in it, then it has healed. He is clean, and the priest is to pronounce him clean. 
03013038	When a man or a woman has white spots on the skin, 
03013039	the priest shall examine them, and if the spots are dull white, it is a harmless rash that has broken out on the skin; the person is clean. 
03013040	Now if a man loses his hair and is bald, he is still clean. 
03013041	Or if his hairline recedes and he is bald on his forehead, he is still clean. 
03013042	But if there is a reddish-white sore on the bald head or forehead, it is an infectious disease breaking out on it. 
03013043	The priest is to examine him, and if the swelling of the infection on his bald head or forehead is reddish-white like a skin disease, 
03013044	the man is diseased; he is unclean. The priest must pronounce him unclean because of the infection on his head. 
03013045	A diseased person must wear torn clothes and let his hair hang loose, and he must cover his mouth and cry out, ‘Unclean, unclean!’ 
03013046	As long as he has the infection, he remains unclean. He must live alone in a place outside the camp. 
03013047	If any fabric is contaminated with mildew —any wool or linen garment, 
03013048	any weave or knit of linen or wool, or any article of leather— 
03013049	and if the mark in the fabric, leather, weave, knit, or leather article is green or red, then it is contaminated with mildew and must be shown to the priest. 
03013050	And the priest is to examine the mildew and isolate the contaminated fabric for seven days. 
03013051	On the seventh day the priest shall reexamine it, and if the mildew has spread in the fabric, weave, knit, or leather, then regardless of how it is used, it is a harmful mildew; the article is unclean. 
03013052	He is to burn the fabric, weave, or knit, whether the contaminated item is wool or linen or leather. Since the mildew is harmful, the article must be burned up. 
03013053	But when the priest reexamines it, if the mildew has not spread in the fabric, weave, knit, or leather article, 
03013054	the priest is to order the contaminated article to be washed and isolated for another seven days. 
03013055	After it has been washed, the priest is to reexamine it, and if the mildewed article has not changed in appearance, it is unclean. Even though the mildew has not spread, you must burn it, whether the rot is on the front or back. 
03013056	If the priest examines it and the mildew has faded after it has been washed, he must cut the contaminated section out of the fabric, leather, weave, or knit. 
03013057	But if it reappears in the fabric, weave, or knit, or on any leather article, it is spreading. You must burn the contaminated article. 
03013058	If the mildew disappears from the fabric, weave, or knit, or any leather article after washing, then it is to be washed again, and it will be clean. 
03013059	This is the law concerning a mildew contamination in wool or linen fabric, weave, or knit, or any leather article, for pronouncing it clean or unclean.” 
03014001	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
03014002	“This is the law for the one afflicted with a skin disease on the day of his cleansing, when he is brought to the priest. 
03014003	The priest is to go outside the camp to examine him, and if the skin disease of the afflicted person has healed, 
03014004	the priest shall order that two live clean birds, cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop be brought for the one to be cleansed. 
03014005	Then the priest shall command that one of the birds be slaughtered over fresh water in a clay pot. 
03014006	And he is to take the live bird together with the cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop, and dip them into the blood of the bird that was slaughtered over the fresh water. 
03014007	Seven times he shall sprinkle the one to be cleansed of the skin disease. Then he shall pronounce him clean and release the live bird into the open field. 
03014008	The one being cleansed must wash his clothes, shave off all his hair, and bathe with water; then he will be ceremonially clean. Afterward, he may enter the camp, but he must remain outside his tent for seven days. 
03014009	On the seventh day he must shave off all his hair—his head, his beard, his eyebrows, and the rest of his hair. He must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water, and he will be clean. 
03014010	On the eighth day he is to bring two unblemished male lambs, an unblemished ewe lamb a year old, a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with olive oil, and one log of olive oil. 
03014011	The priest who performs the cleansing shall present the one to be cleansed, together with these offerings, before the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 
03014012	Then the priest is to take one of the male lambs and present it as a guilt offering, along with the log of olive oil; and he must wave them as a wave offering before the LORD. 
03014013	Then he is to slaughter the lamb in the sanctuary area where the sin offering and burnt offering are slaughtered. Like the sin offering, the guilt offering belongs to the priest; it is most holy. 
03014014	The priest is to take some of the blood from the guilt offering and put it on the right earlobe of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. 
03014015	Then the priest shall take some of the log of olive oil, pour it into his left palm, 
03014016	dip his right forefinger into the oil in his left palm, and sprinkle some of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD. 
03014017	And the priest is to put some of the oil remaining in his palm on the right earlobe of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on top of the blood of the guilt offering. 
03014018	The rest of the oil in his palm, the priest is to put on the head of the one to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before the LORD. 
03014019	Then the priest is to sacrifice the sin offering and make atonement for the one to be cleansed from his uncleanness. After that, the priest shall slaughter the burnt offering 
03014020	and offer it on the altar, with the grain offering, to make atonement for him, and he will be clean. 
03014021	If, however, the person is poor and cannot afford these offerings, he is to take one male lamb as a guilt offering to be waved to make atonement for him, along with a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with olive oil for a grain offering, a log of olive oil, 
03014022	and two turtledoves or two young pigeons, whichever he can afford, one to be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering. 
03014023	On the eighth day he is to bring them for his cleansing to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting before the LORD. 
03014024	The priest shall take the lamb for the guilt offering, along with the log of olive oil, and wave them as a wave offering before the LORD. 
03014025	And after he slaughters the lamb for the guilt offering, the priest is to take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the right earlobe of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. 
03014026	Then the priest is to pour some of the oil into his left palm 
03014027	and sprinkle with his right forefinger some of the oil in his left palm seven times before the LORD. 
03014028	The priest shall also put some of the oil in his palm on the right earlobe of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot—on the same places as the blood of the guilt offering. 
03014029	The rest of the oil in his palm, the priest is to put on the head of the one to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before the LORD. 
03014030	Then he must sacrifice the turtledoves or young pigeons, whichever he can afford, 
03014031	one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, together with the grain offering. In this way the priest will make atonement before the LORD for the one to be cleansed. 
03014032	This is the law for someone who has a skin disease and cannot afford the cost of his cleansing.” 
03014033	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 
03014034	“When you enter the land of Canaan, which I am giving you as your possession, and I put a contamination of mildew into a house in that land, 
03014035	the owner of the house shall come and tell the priest, ‘Something like mildew has appeared in my house.’ 
03014036	The priest must order that the house be cleared before he enters it to examine the mildew, so that nothing in the house will become unclean. After this, the priest shall go in to inspect the house. 
03014037	He is to examine the house, and if the mildew on the walls consists of green or red depressions that appear to be beneath the surface of the wall, 
03014038	the priest shall go outside the doorway of the house and close it up for seven days. 
03014039	On the seventh day the priest is to return and inspect the house. If the mildew has spread on the walls, 
03014040	he must order that the contaminated stones be pulled out and thrown into an unclean place outside the city. 
03014041	And he shall have the inside of the house scraped completely and the plaster that is scraped off dumped into an unclean place outside the city. 
03014042	So different stones must be obtained to replace the contaminated ones, as well as additional mortar to replaster the house. 
03014043	If the mildew reappears in the house after the stones have been torn out and the house has been scraped and replastered, 
03014044	the priest must come and inspect it. If the mildew has spread in the house, it is a destructive mildew; the house is unclean. 
03014045	It must be torn down with its stones, its timbers, and all its plaster, and taken outside the city to an unclean place. 
03014046	Anyone who enters the house during any of the days that it is closed up will be unclean until evening. 
03014047	And anyone who sleeps in the house or eats in it must wash his clothes. 
03014048	If, however, the priest comes and inspects it, and the mildew has not spread after the house has been replastered, he shall pronounce the house clean, because the mildew is gone. 
03014049	He is to take two birds, cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop to purify the house; 
03014050	and he shall slaughter one of the birds over fresh water in a clay pot. 
03014051	Then he shall take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the scarlet yarn, and the live bird, dip them in the blood of the slaughtered bird and the fresh water, and sprinkle the house seven times. 
03014052	And he shall cleanse the house with the bird’s blood, the fresh water, the live bird, the cedar wood, the hyssop, and the scarlet yarn. 
03014053	Finally, he is to release the live bird into the open fields outside the city. In this way he will make atonement for the house, and it will be clean. 
03014054	This is the law for any infectious skin disease, for a scaly outbreak, 
03014055	for mildew in clothing or in a house, 
03014056	and for a swelling, rash, or spot, 
03014057	to determine when something is clean or unclean. This is the law regarding skin diseases and mildew.” 
03015001	And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 
03015002	“Say to the Israelites, ‘When any man has a bodily discharge, the discharge is unclean. 
03015003	This uncleanness is from his discharge, whether his body allows the discharge to flow or blocks it. So his discharge will bring about uncleanness. 
03015004	Any bed on which the man with the discharge lies will be unclean, and any furniture on which he sits will be unclean. 
03015005	Anyone who touches his bed must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean until evening. 
03015006	Whoever sits on furniture on which the man with the discharge was sitting must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean until evening. 
03015007	Whoever touches the body of the man with a discharge must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean until evening. 
03015008	If the man with the discharge spits on one who is clean, that person must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean until evening. 
03015009	Any saddle on which the man with the discharge rides will be unclean. 
03015010	Whoever touches anything that was under him will be unclean until evening, and whoever carries such things must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean until evening. 
03015011	If the man with the discharge touches anyone without first rinsing his hands with water, the one who was touched must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean until evening. 
03015012	Any clay pot that the man with the discharge touches must be broken, and any wooden utensil must be rinsed with water. 
03015013	When the man has been cleansed from his discharge, he must count off seven days for his cleansing, wash his clothes, and bathe himself in fresh water, and he shall be clean. 
03015014	On the eighth day he is to take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, come before the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, and give them to the priest. 
03015015	The priest is to sacrifice them, one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for the man before the LORD because of his discharge. 
03015016	When a man has an emission of semen, he must bathe his whole body with water, and he will be unclean until evening. 
03015017	Any clothing or leather on which there is an emission of semen must be washed with water, and it will remain unclean until evening. 
03015018	If a man lies with a woman and there is an emission of semen, both must bathe with water, and they will remain unclean until evening. 
03015019	When a woman has a discharge consisting of blood from her body, she will be unclean due to her menstruation for seven days, and anyone who touches her will be unclean until evening. 
03015020	Anything on which she lies or sits during her menstruation will be unclean, 
03015021	and anyone who touches her bed must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean until evening. 
03015022	Whoever touches any furniture on which she was sitting must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean until evening. 
03015023	And whether it is a bed or furniture on which she was sitting, whoever touches it will be unclean until evening. 
03015024	If a man lies with her and her menstrual flow touches him, he will be unclean for seven days, and any bed on which he lies will become unclean. 
03015025	When a woman has a discharge of her blood for many days at a time other than her menstrual period, or if it continues beyond her period, she will be unclean all the days of her unclean discharge, just as she is during the days of her menstruation. 
03015026	Any bed on which she lies or any furniture on which she sits during the days of her discharge will be unclean, like her bed during her menstrual period. 
03015027	Anyone who touches these things will be unclean; he must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean until evening. 
03015028	When a woman is cleansed of her discharge, she must count off seven days, and after that she will be ceremonially clean. 
03015029	On the eighth day she is to take two turtledoves or two young pigeons and bring them to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 
03015030	The priest is to sacrifice one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for her before the LORD for her unclean discharge. 
03015031	You must keep the children of Israel separate from their uncleanness, so that they do not die by defiling My tabernacle, which is among them. 
03015032	This is the law of him who has a discharge, of the man who has an emission of semen whereby he is unclean, 
03015033	of a woman in her menstrual period, of any male or female who has a discharge, and of a man who lies with an unclean woman.’” 
03016001	Now the LORD spoke to Moses after the death of two of Aaron’s sons when they approached the presence of the LORD. 
03016002	And the LORD said to Moses: “Tell your brother Aaron not to enter freely into the Most Holy Place behind the veil in front of the mercy seat on the ark, or else he will die, because I appear in the cloud above the mercy seat. 
03016003	This is how Aaron is to enter the Holy Place: with a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering. 
03016004	He is to wear the sacred linen tunic, with linen undergarments. He must tie a linen sash around him and put on the linen turban. These are holy garments, and he must bathe himself with water before he wears them. 
03016005	And he shall take from the congregation of Israel two male goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering. 
03016006	Aaron is to present the bull for his sin offering and make atonement for himself and his household. 
03016007	Then he shall take the two goats and present them before the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 
03016008	After Aaron casts lots for the two goats, one for the LORD and the other for the scapegoat, 
03016009	he shall present the goat chosen by lot for the LORD and sacrifice it as a sin offering. 
03016010	But the goat chosen by lot as the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the LORD to make atonement by sending it into the wilderness as the scapegoat. 
03016011	When Aaron presents the bull for his sin offering and makes atonement for himself and his household, he is to slaughter the bull for his own sin offering. 
03016012	Then he must take a censer full of burning coals from the altar before the LORD, and two handfuls of finely ground fragrant incense, and take them inside the veil. 
03016013	He is to put the incense on the fire before the LORD, and the cloud of incense will cover the mercy seat above the Testimony, so that he will not die. 
03016014	And he is to take some of the bull’s blood and sprinkle it with his finger on the east side of the mercy seat; then he shall sprinkle some of it with his finger seven times before the mercy seat. 
03016015	Aaron shall then slaughter the goat for the sin offering for the people and bring its blood behind the veil, and with its blood he must do as he did with the bull’s blood: He is to sprinkle it against the mercy seat and in front of it. 
03016016	So he shall make atonement for the Most Holy Place because of the impurities and rebellious acts of the Israelites in regard to all their sins. He is to do the same for the Tent of Meeting which abides among them in the midst of their impurities. 
03016017	No one may be in the Tent of Meeting from the time Aaron goes in to make atonement in the Most Holy Place until he leaves, after he has made atonement for himself, his household, and the whole assembly of Israel. 
03016018	Then he shall go out to the altar that is before the LORD and make atonement for it. He is to take some of the bull’s blood and some of the goat’s blood and put it on all the horns of the altar. 
03016019	He is to sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times to cleanse it and consecrate it from the uncleanness of the Israelites. 
03016020	When Aaron has finished purifying the Most Holy Place, the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, he is to bring forward the live goat. 
03016021	Then he is to lay both hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the iniquities and rebellious acts of the Israelites in regard to all their sins. He is to put them on the goat’s head and send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man appointed for the task. 
03016022	The goat will carry on itself all their iniquities into a solitary place, and the man will release it into the wilderness. 
03016023	Then Aaron is to enter the Tent of Meeting, take off the linen garments he put on before entering the Most Holy Place, and leave them there. 
03016024	He is to bathe himself with water in a holy place and put on his own clothes. Then he must go out and sacrifice his burnt offering and the people’s burnt offering to make atonement for himself and for the people. 
03016025	He is also to burn the fat of the sin offering on the altar. 
03016026	The man who released the goat as the scapegoat must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water; afterward he may reenter the camp. 
03016027	The bull for the sin offering and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought into the Most Holy Place to make atonement, must be taken outside the camp; and their hides, flesh, and dung must be burned up. 
03016028	The one who burns them must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water, and afterward he may reenter the camp. 
03016029	This is to be a permanent statute for you: On the tenth day of the seventh month, you shall humble yourselves and not do any work—whether the native or the foreigner who resides among you— 
03016030	because on this day atonement will be made for you to cleanse you, and you will be clean from all your sins before the LORD. 
03016031	It is a Sabbath of complete rest for you, that you may humble yourselves; it is a permanent statute. 
03016032	The priest who is anointed and ordained to succeed his father as high priest shall make atonement. He will put on the sacred linen garments 
03016033	and make atonement for the Most Holy Place, the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, and for the priests and all the people of the assembly. 
03016034	This is to be a permanent statute for you, to make atonement once a year for the Israelites because of all their sins.” And all this was done as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
03017001	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
03017002	“Speak to Aaron, his sons, and all the Israelites and tell them this is what the LORD has commanded: 
03017003	‘Anyone from the house of Israel who slaughters an ox, a lamb, or a goat in the camp or outside of it 
03017004	instead of bringing it to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting to present it as an offering to the LORD before His tabernacle—that man shall incur bloodguilt. He has shed blood and must be cut off from among his people. 
03017005	For this reason the Israelites will bring to the LORD the sacrifices they have been offering in the open fields. They are to bring them to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and offer them as sacrifices of peace offerings to the LORD. 
03017006	The priest will then splatter the blood on the altar of the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and burn the fat as a pleasing aroma to the LORD. 
03017007	They must no longer offer their sacrifices to the goat demons to which they have prostituted themselves. This will be a permanent statute for them for the generations to come.’ 
03017008	Tell them that if anyone from the house of Israel or any foreigner living among them offers a burnt offering or a sacrifice 
03017009	but does not bring it to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting to sacrifice it to the LORD, that man must be cut off from his people. 
03017010	If anyone from the house of Israel or a foreigner living among them eats any blood, I will set My face against that person and cut him off from among his people. 
03017011	For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for your souls upon the altar; for it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul. 
03017012	Therefore I say to the Israelites, ‘None of you may eat blood, nor may any foreigner living among you eat blood.’ 
03017013	And if any Israelite or foreigner living among them hunts down a wild animal or bird that may be eaten, he must drain its blood and cover it with dirt. 
03017014	For the life of all flesh is its blood. Therefore I have told the Israelites, ‘You must not eat the blood of any living thing, because the life of all flesh is its blood; whoever eats it must be cut off.’ 
03017015	And any person, whether native or foreigner, who eats anything found dead or mauled by wild beasts must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean until evening; then he will be clean. 
03017016	But if he does not wash his clothes and bathe himself, then he shall bear his iniquity.” 
03018001	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
03018002	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: I am the LORD your God. 
03018003	You must not follow the practices of the land of Egypt, where you used to live, and you must not follow the practices of the land of Canaan, into which I am bringing you. You must not walk in their customs. 
03018004	You are to practice My judgments and keep My statutes by walking in them. I am the LORD your God. 
03018005	Keep My statutes and My judgments, for the man who does these things will live by them. I am the LORD. 
03018006	None of you are to approach any close relative to have sexual relations. I am the LORD. 
03018007	You must not expose the nakedness of your father by having sexual relations with your mother. She is your mother; you must not have sexual relations with her. 
03018008	You must not have sexual relations with your father’s wife; it would dishonor your father. 
03018009	You must not have sexual relations with your sister, either your father’s daughter or your mother’s daughter, whether she was born in the same home or elsewhere. 
03018010	You must not have sexual relations with your son’s daughter or your daughter’s daughter, for that would shame your family. 
03018011	You must not have sexual relations with the daughter of your father’s wife, born to your father; she is your sister. 
03018012	You must not have sexual relations with your father’s sister; she is your father’s close relative. 
03018013	You must not have sexual relations with your mother’s sister, for she is your mother’s close relative. 
03018014	You must not dishonor your father’s brother by approaching his wife to have sexual relations with her; she is your aunt. 
03018015	You must not have sexual relations with your daughter-in-law. She is your son’s wife; you are not to have sexual relations with her. 
03018016	You must not have sexual relations with your brother’s wife; that would shame your brother. 
03018017	You must not have sexual relations with both a woman and her daughter. You are not to marry her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter and have sexual relations with her. They are close relatives; it is depraved. 
03018018	You must not take your wife’s sister as a rival wife and have sexual relations with her while your wife is still alive. 
03018019	You must not approach a woman to have sexual relations with her during her menstrual period. 
03018020	You must not lie carnally with your neighbor’s wife and thus defile yourself with her. 
03018021	You must not give any of your children to be sacrificed to Molech, for you must not profane the name of your God. I am the LORD. 
03018022	You must not lie with a man as with a woman; that is an abomination. 
03018023	You must not lie carnally with any animal, thus defiling yourself with it; a woman must not stand before an animal to mate with it; that is a perversion. 
03018024	Do not defile yourselves by any of these practices, for by all these things the nations I am driving out before you have defiled themselves. 
03018025	Even the land has become defiled, so I am punishing it for its sin, and the land will vomit out its inhabitants. 
03018026	But you are to keep My statutes and ordinances, and you must not commit any of these abominations—neither your native-born nor the foreigner who lives among you. 
03018027	For the men who were in the land before you committed all these abominations, and the land has become defiled. 
03018028	So if you defile the land, it will vomit you out as it spewed out the nations before you. 
03018029	Therefore anyone who commits any of these abominations must be cut off from among his people. 
03018030	You must keep My charge not to practice any of the abominable customs that were practiced before you, so that you do not defile yourselves by them. I am the LORD your God.” 
03019001	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
03019002	“Speak to the whole congregation of Israel and tell them: Be holy because I, the LORD your God, am holy. 
03019003	Each of you must respect his mother and father, and you must keep My Sabbaths. I am the LORD your God. 
03019004	Do not turn to idols or make for yourselves molten gods. I am the LORD your God. 
03019005	When you sacrifice a peace offering to the LORD, you shall offer it for your acceptance. 
03019006	It shall be eaten on the day you sacrifice it, or on the next day; but what remains on the third day must be burned up. 
03019007	If any of it is eaten on the third day, it is tainted and will not be accepted. 
03019008	Whoever eats it will bear his iniquity, for he has profaned what is holy to the LORD. That person must be cut off from his people. 
03019009	When you reap the harvest of your land, you are not to reap to the very edges of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest. 
03019010	You must not strip your vineyard bare or gather its fallen grapes. Leave them for the poor and the foreigner. I am the LORD your God. 
03019011	You must not steal. You must not lie or deceive one another. 
03019012	You must not swear falsely by My name and so profane the name of your God. I am the LORD. 
03019013	You must not defraud your neighbor or rob him. You must not withhold until morning the wages due a hired hand. 
03019014	You must not curse the deaf or place a stumbling block before the blind, but you shall fear your God. I am the LORD. 
03019015	You must not pervert justice; you must not show partiality to the poor or favoritism to the rich; you are to judge your neighbor fairly. 
03019016	You must not go about spreading slander among your people. You must not endanger the life of your neighbor. I am the LORD. 
03019017	You must not harbor hatred against your brother in your heart. Directly rebuke your neighbor, so that you will not incur guilt on account of him. 
03019018	Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against any of your people, but love your neighbor as yourself. I am the LORD. 
03019019	You are to keep My statutes. You shall not crossbreed two different kinds of livestock; you shall not sow your fields with two kinds of seed; and you shall not wear clothing made of two kinds of material. 
03019020	If a man lies carnally with a slave girl promised to another man but who has not been redeemed or given her freedom, there must be due punishment. But they are not to be put to death, because she had not been freed. 
03019021	The man, however, must bring a ram to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting as his guilt offering to the LORD. 
03019022	The priest shall make atonement on his behalf before the LORD with the ram of the guilt offering for the sin he has committed, and he will be forgiven the sin he has committed. 
03019023	When you enter the land and plant any kind of tree for food, you shall regard the fruit as forbidden. For three years it will be forbidden to you and must not be eaten. 
03019024	In the fourth year all its fruit must be consecrated as a praise offering to the LORD. 
03019025	But in the fifth year you may eat its fruit; thus your harvest will be increased. I am the LORD your God. 
03019026	You must not eat anything with blood still in it. You must not practice divination or sorcery. 
03019027	You must not cut off the hair at the sides of your head or clip off the edges of your beard. 
03019028	You must not make any cuts in your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves. I am the LORD. 
03019029	You must not defile your daughter by making her a prostitute, or the land will be prostituted and filled with depravity. 
03019030	You must keep My Sabbaths and have reverence for My sanctuary. I am the LORD. 
03019031	You must not turn to mediums or spiritists; do not seek them out, or you will be defiled by them. I am the LORD your God. 
03019032	You are to rise in the presence of the elderly, honor the aged, and fear your God. I am the LORD. 
03019033	When a foreigner resides with you in your land, you must not oppress him. 
03019034	You must treat the foreigner living among you as native-born and love him as yourself, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God. 
03019035	You must not use dishonest measures of length, weight, or volume. 
03019036	You shall maintain honest scales and weights, an honest ephah, and an honest hin. I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt. 
03019037	You must keep all My statutes and all My ordinances and follow them. I am the LORD.” 
03020001	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
03020002	“Tell the Israelites, ‘Any Israelite or foreigner living in Israel who gives any of his children to Molech must be put to death. The people of the land are to stone him. 
03020003	And I will set My face against that man and cut him off from his people, because by giving his offspring to Molech, he has defiled My sanctuary and profaned My holy name. 
03020004	And if the people of the land ever hide their eyes and fail to put to death the man who gives one of his children to Molech, 
03020005	then I will set My face against that man and his family and cut off from among their people both him and all who follow him in prostituting themselves with Molech. 
03020006	Whoever turns to mediums or spiritists to prostitute himself with them, I will also set My face against that person and cut him off from his people. 
03020007	Consecrate yourselves, therefore, and be holy, because I am the LORD your God. 
03020008	And you shall keep My statutes and practice them. I am the LORD who sanctifies you. 
03020009	If anyone curses his father or mother, he must be put to death. He has cursed his father or mother; his blood shall be upon him. 
03020010	If a man commits adultery with another man’s wife—with the wife of his neighbor—both the adulterer and the adulteress must surely be put to death. 
03020011	If a man lies with his father’s wife, he has uncovered his father’s nakedness. Both must surely be put to death; their blood is upon them. 
03020012	If a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both must surely be put to death. They have acted perversely; their blood is upon them. 
03020013	If a man lies with a man as with a woman, they have both committed an abomination. They must surely be put to death; their blood is upon them. 
03020014	If a man marries both a woman and her mother, it is depraved. Both he and they must be burned in the fire, so that there will be no depravity among you. 
03020015	If a man lies carnally with an animal, he must be put to death. And you are also to kill the animal. 
03020016	If a woman approaches any animal to mate with it, you must kill both the woman and the animal. They must surely be put to death; their blood is upon them. 
03020017	If a man marries his sister, whether the daughter of his father or of his mother, and they have sexual relations, it is a disgrace. They must be cut off in the sight of their people. He has uncovered the nakedness of his sister; he shall bear his iniquity. 
03020018	If a man lies with a menstruating woman and has sexual relations with her, he has exposed the source of her flow, and she has uncovered the source of her blood. Both of them must be cut off from among their people. 
03020019	You must not have sexual relations with the sister of your mother or your father, for it is exposing one’s own kin; both shall bear their iniquity. 
03020020	If a man lies with his uncle’s wife, he has uncovered the nakedness of his uncle. They will bear their sin; they shall die childless. 
03020021	If a man marries his brother’s wife, it is an act of impurity. He has uncovered the nakedness of his brother; they shall be childless. 
03020022	You are therefore to keep all My statutes and ordinances, so that the land where I am bringing you to live will not vomit you out. 
03020023	You must not follow the statutes of the nations I am driving out before you. Because they did all these things, I abhorred them. 
03020024	But I have told you that you will inherit their land, since I will give it to you as an inheritance—a land flowing with milk and honey. I am the LORD your God, who has set you apart from the peoples. 
03020025	You are therefore to distinguish between clean and unclean animals and birds. Do not become contaminated by any animal or bird, or by anything that crawls on the ground; I have set these apart as unclean for you. 
03020026	You are to be holy to Me because I, the LORD, am holy, and I have set you apart from the nations to be My own. 
03020027	A man or a woman who is a medium or spiritist must surely be put to death. They shall be stoned; their blood is upon them.’” 
03021001	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Speak to Aaron’s sons, the priests, and tell them that a priest is not to defile himself for a dead person among his people, 
03021002	except for his immediate family—his mother, father, son, daughter, or brother, 
03021003	or his unmarried sister who is near to him, since she has no husband. 
03021004	He is not to defile himself for those related to him by marriage, and so profane himself. 
03021005	Priests must not make bald spots on their heads, shave off the edges of their beards, or make cuts in their bodies. 
03021006	They must be holy to their God and not profane the name of their God. Because they present to the LORD the food offerings, the food of their God, they must be holy. 
03021007	A priest must not marry a woman defiled by prostitution or divorced by her husband, for the priest is holy to his God. 
03021008	You are to regard him as holy, since he presents the food of your God. He shall be holy to you, because I the LORD am holy—I who set you apart. 
03021009	If a priest’s daughter defiles herself by prostituting herself, she profanes her father; she must be burned in the fire. 
03021010	The priest who is highest among his brothers, who has had the anointing oil poured on his head and has been ordained to wear the priestly garments, must not let his hair hang loose or tear his garments. 
03021011	He must not go near any dead body; he must not defile himself, even for his father or mother. 
03021012	He must not leave or desecrate the sanctuary of his God, for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is on him. I am the LORD. 
03021013	The woman he marries must be a virgin. 
03021014	He is not to marry a widow, a divorced woman, or one defiled by prostitution. He is to marry a virgin from his own people, 
03021015	so that he does not defile his offspring among his people, for I am the LORD who sanctifies him.” 
03021016	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
03021017	“Say to Aaron, ‘For the generations to come, none of your descendants who has a physical defect may approach to offer the food of his God. 
03021018	No man who has any defect may approach—no man who is blind, lame, disfigured, or deformed; 
03021019	no man who has a broken foot or hand, 
03021020	or who is a hunchback or dwarf, or who has an eye defect, a festering rash, scabs, or a crushed testicle. 
03021021	No descendant of Aaron the priest who has a defect shall approach to present the food offerings to the LORD. Since he has a defect, he is not to come near to offer the food of his God. 
03021022	He may eat the most holy food of his God as well as the holy food, 
03021023	but because he has a defect, he must not go near the veil or approach the altar, so as not to desecrate My sanctuaries. For I am the LORD who sanctifies them.’” 
03021024	Moses told this to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites. 
03022001	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
03022002	“Tell Aaron and his sons to treat with respect the sacred offerings that the Israelites have consecrated to Me, so that they do not profane My holy name. I am the LORD. 
03022003	Tell them that for the generations to come, if any of their descendants in a state of uncleanness approaches the sacred offerings that the Israelites consecrate to the LORD, that person must be cut off from My presence. I am the LORD. 
03022004	If a descendant of Aaron has a skin disease or a discharge, he may not eat the sacred offerings until he is clean. Whoever touches anything defiled by a corpse or by a man who has an emission of semen, 
03022005	or whoever touches a crawling creature or a person that makes him unclean, whatever the uncleanness may be— 
03022006	the man who touches any of these will remain unclean until evening. He must not eat from the sacred offerings unless he has bathed himself with water. 
03022007	When the sun has set, he will become clean, and then he may eat from the sacred offerings, for they are his food. 
03022008	He must not eat anything found dead or torn by wild animals, which would make him unclean. I am the LORD. 
03022009	The priests must keep My charge, lest they bear the guilt and die because they profane it. I am the LORD who sanctifies them. 
03022010	No one outside a priest’s family may eat the sacred offering, nor may the guest of a priest or his hired hand eat it. 
03022011	But if a priest buys a slave with his own money, or if a slave is born in his household, that slave may eat his food. 
03022012	If the priest’s daughter is married to a man other than a priest, she is not to eat of the sacred contributions. 
03022013	But if a priest’s daughter with no children becomes widowed or divorced and returns to her father’s house, she may share her father’s food as in her youth. But no outsider may share it. 
03022014	If anyone eats a sacred offering in error, he must add a fifth to its value and give the sacred offering to the priest. 
03022015	The priests must not profane the sacred offerings that the Israelites present to the LORD 
03022016	by allowing the people to eat the sacred offerings and thus to bear the punishment for guilt. For I am the LORD who sanctifies them.” 
03022017	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
03022018	“Speak to Aaron and his sons and all the Israelites and tell them, ‘Any man of the house of Israel or any foreign resident who presents a gift for a burnt offering to the LORD, whether to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering, 
03022019	must offer an unblemished male from the cattle, sheep, or goats in order for it to be accepted on your behalf. 
03022020	You must not present anything with a defect, because it will not be accepted on your behalf. 
03022021	When a man presents a peace offering to the LORD from the herd or flock to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering, it must be without blemish or defect to be acceptable. 
03022022	You are not to present to the LORD any animal that is blind, injured, or maimed, or anything with a running sore, a festering rash, or a scab; you must not put any of these on the altar as a food offering to the LORD. 
03022023	You may present as a freewill offering an ox or sheep that has a deformed or stunted limb, but it is not acceptable in fulfillment of a vow. 
03022024	You are not to present to the LORD an animal whose testicles are bruised, crushed, torn, or cut; you are not to sacrifice them in your land. 
03022025	Neither you nor a foreigner shall present food to your God from any such animal. They will not be accepted on your behalf, because they are deformed and flawed.’” 
03022026	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
03022027	“When an ox, a sheep, or a goat is born, it must remain with its mother for seven days. From the eighth day on, it will be acceptable as a food offering presented to the LORD. 
03022028	But you must not slaughter an ox or a sheep on the same day as its young. 
03022029	When you sacrifice a thank offering to the LORD, offer it so that it may be acceptable on your behalf. 
03022030	It must be eaten that same day. Do not leave any of it until morning. I am the LORD. 
03022031	You are to keep My commandments and practice them. I am the LORD. 
03022032	You must not profane My holy name. I must be acknowledged as holy among the Israelites. I am the LORD who sanctifies you, 
03022033	who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am the LORD.” 
03023001	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
03023002	“Speak to the Israelites and say to them, ‘These are My appointed feasts, the feasts of the LORD that you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies. 
03023003	For six days work may be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of complete rest, a day of sacred assembly. You must not do any work; wherever you live, it is a Sabbath to the LORD. 
03023004	These are the LORD’s appointed feasts, the sacred assemblies you are to proclaim at their appointed times. 
03023005	The Passover to the LORD begins at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month. 
03023006	On the fifteenth day of the same month begins the Feast of Unleavened Bread to the LORD. For seven days you must eat unleavened bread. 
03023007	On the first day you are to hold a sacred assembly; you are not to do any regular work. 
03023008	For seven days you are to present a food offering to the LORD. On the seventh day there shall be a sacred assembly; you must not do any regular work.’” 
03023009	And the LORD said to Moses, 
03023010	“Speak to the Israelites and say, ‘When you enter the land that I am giving you and you reap its harvest, you are to bring to the priest a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest. 
03023011	And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD so that it may be accepted on your behalf; the priest is to wave it on the day after the Sabbath. 
03023012	On the day you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a year-old lamb without blemish as a burnt offering to the LORD, 
03023013	along with its grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil—a food offering to the LORD, a pleasing aroma—and its drink offering of a quarter hin of wine. 
03023014	You must not eat any bread or roasted or new grain until the very day you have brought this offering to your God. This is to be a permanent statute for the generations to come, wherever you live. 
03023015	From the day after the Sabbath, the day you brought the sheaf of the wave offering, you are to count off seven full weeks. 
03023016	You shall count off fifty days until the day after the seventh Sabbath, and then present an offering of new grain to the LORD. 
03023017	Bring two loaves of bread from your dwellings as a wave offering, each made from two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour, baked with leaven, as the firstfruits to the LORD. 
03023018	Along with the bread you are to present seven unblemished male lambs a year old, one young bull, and two rams. They will be a burnt offering to the LORD, together with their grain offerings and drink offerings—a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. 
03023019	You shall also prepare one male goat as a sin offering and two male lambs a year old as a peace offering. 
03023020	The priest is to wave the lambs as a wave offering before the LORD, together with the bread of the firstfruits. The bread and the two lambs shall be holy to the LORD for the priest. 
03023021	On that same day you are to proclaim a sacred assembly, and you must not do any regular work. This is to be a permanent statute wherever you live for the generations to come. 
03023022	When you reap the harvest of your land, do not reap all the way to the edges of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest. Leave them for the poor and the foreign resident. I am the LORD your God.’” 
03023023	The LORD also said to Moses, 
03023024	“Speak to the Israelites and say, ‘On the first day of the seventh month you are to have a day of rest, a sacred assembly announced by trumpet blasts. 
03023025	You must not do any regular work, but you are to present a food offering to the LORD.’” 
03023026	Again the LORD said to Moses, 
03023027	“The tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement. You shall hold a sacred assembly and humble yourselves, and present a food offering to the LORD. 
03023028	On this day you are not to do any work, for it is the Day of Atonement, when atonement is made for you before the LORD your God. 
03023029	If anyone does not humble himself on this day, he must be cut off from his people. 
03023030	I will destroy from among his people anyone who does any work on this day. 
03023031	You are not to do any work at all. This is a permanent statute for the generations to come, wherever you live. 
03023032	It will be a Sabbath of complete rest for you, and you shall humble yourselves. From the evening of the ninth day of the month until the following evening you are to keep your Sabbath.” 
03023033	And the LORD said to Moses, 
03023034	“Speak to the Israelites and say, ‘On the fifteenth day of the seventh month the Feast of Tabernacles to the LORD begins, and it continues for seven days. 
03023035	On the first day there shall be a sacred assembly. You must not do any regular work. 
03023036	For seven days you are to present a food offering to the LORD. On the eighth day you are to hold a sacred assembly and present a food offering to the LORD. It is a solemn assembly; you must not do any regular work. 
03023037	These are the LORD’s appointed feasts, which you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies for presenting food offerings to the LORD—burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings, each on its designated day. 
03023038	These offerings are in addition to the offerings for the LORD’s Sabbaths, and in addition to your gifts, to all your vow offerings, and to all the freewill offerings you give to the LORD. 
03023039	On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, after you have gathered the produce of the land, you are to celebrate a feast to the LORD for seven days. There shall be complete rest on the first day and also on the eighth day. 
03023040	On the first day you are to gather the fruit of majestic trees, the branches of palm trees, and the boughs of leafy trees and of willows of the brook. And you are to rejoice before the LORD your God for seven days. 
03023041	You are to celebrate this as a feast to the LORD for seven days each year. This is a permanent statute for the generations to come; you are to celebrate it in the seventh month. 
03023042	You are to dwell in booths for seven days. All the native-born of Israel must dwell in booths, 
03023043	so that your descendants may know that I made the Israelites dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.’” 
03023044	So Moses announced to the Israelites the appointed feasts of the LORD. 
03024001	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
03024002	“Command the Israelites to bring you pure oil of pressed olives for the light, to keep the lamps burning continually. 
03024003	Outside the veil of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, Aaron is to tend the lamps continually before the LORD from evening until morning. This is to be a permanent statute for the generations to come. 
03024004	He shall tend the lamps on the pure gold lampstand before the LORD continually. 
03024005	You are also to take fine flour and bake twelve loaves, using two-tenths of an ephah for each loaf, 
03024006	and set them in two rows—six per row—on the table of pure gold before the LORD. 
03024007	And you are to place pure frankincense near each row, so that it may serve as a memorial portion for the bread, a food offering to the LORD. 
03024008	Every Sabbath day the bread is to be set out before the LORD on behalf of the Israelites as a permanent covenant. 
03024009	It belongs to Aaron and his sons, who are to eat it in a holy place; for it is to him a most holy part of the food offerings to the LORD—his portion forever.” 
03024010	Now the son of an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father went out among the Israelites, and a fight broke out in the camp between him and an Israelite. 
03024011	The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name with a curse. So they brought him to Moses. (His mother’s name was Shelomith daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.) 
03024012	They placed him in custody until the will of the LORD should be made clear to them. 
03024013	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
03024014	“Take the blasphemer outside the camp, and have all who heard him lay their hands on his head; then have the whole assembly stone him. 
03024015	And you are to tell the Israelites, ‘If anyone curses his God, he shall bear the consequences of his sin. 
03024016	Whoever blasphemes the name of the LORD must surely be put to death; the whole assembly must surely stone him, whether he is a foreign resident or native; if he blasphemes the Name, he must be put to death. 
03024017	And if a man takes the life of anyone else, he must surely be put to death. 
03024018	Whoever kills an animal must make restitution—life for life. 
03024019	If anyone injures his neighbor, whatever he has done must be done to him: 
03024020	fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. Just as he injured the other person, the same must be inflicted on him. 
03024021	Whoever kills an animal must make restitution, but whoever kills a man must be put to death. 
03024022	You are to have the same standard of law for the foreign resident and the native; for I am the LORD your God.’” 
03024023	Then Moses spoke to the Israelites, and they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him. So the Israelites did as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
03025001	Then the LORD said to Moses on Mount Sinai, 
03025002	“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: When you enter the land that I am giving you, the land itself must observe a Sabbath to the LORD. 
03025003	For six years you may sow your field and prune your vineyard and gather its crops. 
03025004	But in the seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of complete rest for the land—a Sabbath to the LORD. You are not to sow your field or prune your vineyard. 
03025005	You are not to reap the aftergrowth of your harvest or gather the grapes of your untended vines. The land must have a year of complete rest. 
03025006	Whatever the land yields during the Sabbath year shall be food for you—for yourself, your manservant and maidservant, the hired hand or foreigner who stays with you, 
03025007	and for your livestock and the wild animals in your land. All its growth may serve as food. 
03025008	And you shall count off seven Sabbaths of years—seven times seven years—so that the seven Sabbaths of years amount to forty-nine years. 
03025009	Then you are to sound the horn far and wide on the tenth day of the seventh month, the Day of Atonement. You shall sound it throughout your land. 
03025010	So you are to consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty in the land for all its inhabitants. It shall be your Jubilee, when each of you is to return to his property and to his clan. 
03025011	The fiftieth year will be a Jubilee for you; you are not to sow the land or reap its aftergrowth or harvest the untended vines. 
03025012	For it is a Jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You may eat only the crops taken directly from the field. 
03025013	In this Year of Jubilee, each of you shall return to his own property. 
03025014	If you make a sale to your neighbor or a purchase from him, you must not take advantage of each other. 
03025015	You are to buy from your neighbor according to the number of years since the last Jubilee; he is to sell to you according to the number of harvest years remaining. 
03025016	You shall increase the price in proportion to a greater number of years, or decrease it in proportion to a lesser number of years; for he is selling you a given number of harvests. 
03025017	Do not take advantage of each other, but fear your God; for I am the LORD your God. 
03025018	You are to keep My statutes and carefully observe My judgments, so that you may dwell securely in the land. 
03025019	Then the land will yield its fruit, so that you can eat your fill and dwell in safety in the land. 
03025020	Now you may wonder, ‘What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not sow or gather our produce?’ 
03025021	But I will send My blessing upon you in the sixth year, so that the land will yield a crop sufficient for three years. 
03025022	While you are sowing in the eighth year, you will be eating from the previous harvest, until the ninth year’s harvest comes in. 
03025023	The land must not be sold permanently, because it is Mine, and you are but foreigners and residents with Me. 
03025024	Thus for every piece of property you possess, you must provide for the redemption of the land. 
03025025	If your brother becomes impoverished and sells some of his property, his nearest of kin may come and redeem what his brother has sold. 
03025026	Or if a man has no one to redeem it for him, but he prospers and acquires enough to redeem his land, 
03025027	he shall calculate the years since its sale, repay the balance to the man to whom he sold it, and return to his property. 
03025028	But if he cannot obtain enough to repay him, what he sold will remain in possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee. In the Jubilee, however, it is to be released, so that he may return to his property. 
03025029	If a man sells a house in a walled city, he retains his right of redemption until a full year after its sale; during that year it may be redeemed. 
03025030	If it is not redeemed by the end of a full year, then the house in the walled city is permanently transferred to its buyer and his descendants. It is not to be released in the Jubilee. 
03025031	But houses in villages with no walls around them are to be considered as open fields. They may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the Jubilee. 
03025032	As for the cities of the Levites, the Levites always have the right to redeem their houses in the cities they possess. 
03025033	So whatever belongs to the Levites may be redeemed—a house sold in a city they possess—and must be released in the Jubilee, because the houses in the cities of the Levites are their possession among the Israelites. 
03025034	But the open pastureland around their cities may not be sold, for this is their permanent possession. 
03025035	Now if your countryman becomes destitute and cannot support himself among you, then you are to help him as you would a foreigner or stranger, so that he can continue to live among you. 
03025036	Do not take any interest or profit from him, but fear your God, that your countryman may live among you. 
03025037	You must not lend him your silver at interest or sell him your food for profit. 
03025038	I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God. 
03025039	If a countryman among you becomes destitute and sells himself to you, then you must not force him into slave labor. 
03025040	Let him stay with you as a hired worker or temporary resident; he is to work for you until the Year of Jubilee. 
03025041	Then he and his children are to be released, and he may return to his clan and to the property of his fathers. 
03025042	Because the Israelites are My servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt, they are not to be sold as slaves. 
03025043	You are not to rule over them harshly, but you shall fear your God. 
03025044	Your menservants and maidservants shall come from the nations around you, from whom you may purchase them. 
03025045	You may also purchase them from the foreigners residing among you or their clans living among you who are born in your land. These may become your property. 
03025046	You may leave them to your sons after you to inherit as property; you can make them slaves for life. But as for your brothers, the Israelites, no man may rule harshly over his brother. 
03025047	If a foreigner residing among you prospers, but your countryman dwelling near him becomes destitute and sells himself to the foreigner or to a member of his clan, 
03025048	he retains the right of redemption after he has sold himself. One of his brothers may redeem him: 
03025049	either his uncle or cousin or any close relative from his clan may redeem him. Or if he prospers, he may redeem himself. 
03025050	He and his purchaser will then count the time from the year he sold himself up to the Year of Jubilee. The price of his sale will be determined by the number of years, based on the daily wages of a hired hand. 
03025051	If many years remain, he must pay for his redemption in proportion to his purchase price. 
03025052	If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, he is to calculate and pay his redemption according to his remaining years. 
03025053	He shall be treated like a man hired from year to year, but a foreign owner must not rule over him harshly in your sight. 
03025054	Even if he is not redeemed in any of these ways, he and his children shall be released in the Year of Jubilee. 
03025055	For the Israelites are My servants. They are My servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God. 
03026001	“You must not make idols for yourselves or set up a carved image or sacred pillar; you must not place a sculpted stone in your land to bow down to it. For I am the LORD your God. 
03026002	You must keep My Sabbaths and have reverence for My sanctuary. I am the LORD. 
03026003	If you follow My statutes and carefully keep My commandments, 
03026004	I will give you rains in their season, and the land will yield its produce, and the trees of the field will bear their fruit. 
03026005	Your threshing will continue until the grape harvest, and the grape harvest will continue until sowing time; you will have your fill of food to eat and will dwell securely in your land. 
03026006	And I will give peace to the land, and you will lie down with nothing to fear. I will rid the land of dangerous animals, and no sword will pass through your land. 
03026007	You will pursue your enemies, and they will fall by the sword before you. 
03026008	Five of you will pursue a hundred, and a hundred of you will pursue ten thousand, and your enemies will fall by the sword before you. 
03026009	I will turn toward you and make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will establish My covenant with you. 
03026010	You will still be eating the old supply of grain when you need to clear it out to make room for the new. 
03026011	And I will make My dwelling place among you, and My soul will not despise you. 
03026012	I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be My people. 
03026013	I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt so that you would no longer be slaves to the Egyptians. I broke the bars of your yoke and enabled you to walk in uprightness. 
03026014	If, however, you fail to obey Me and to carry out all these commandments, 
03026015	and if you reject My statutes, despise My ordinances, and neglect to carry out all My commandments, and so break My covenant, 
03026016	then this is what I will do to you: I will bring upon you sudden terror, wasting disease, and fever that will destroy your sight and drain your life. You will sow your seed in vain, because your enemies will eat it. 
03026017	And I will set My face against you, so that you will be defeated by your enemies. Those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee when no one pursues you. 
03026018	And if after all this you will not obey Me, I will proceed to punish you sevenfold for your sins. 
03026019	I will break down your stubborn pride and make your sky like iron and your land like bronze, 
03026020	and your strength will be spent in vain. For your land will not yield its produce, and the trees of the land will not bear their fruit. 
03026021	If you walk in hostility toward Me and refuse to obey Me, I will multiply your plagues seven times, according to your sins. 
03026022	I will send wild animals against you to rob you of your children, destroy your livestock, and reduce your numbers, until your roads lie desolate. 
03026023	And if in spite of these things you do not accept My discipline, but continue to walk in hostility toward Me, 
03026024	then I will act with hostility toward you, and I will strike you sevenfold for your sins. 
03026025	And I will bring a sword against you to execute the vengeance of the covenant. Though you withdraw into your cities, I will send a plague among you, and you will be delivered into the hand of the enemy. 
03026026	When I cut off your supply of bread, ten women will bake your bread in a single oven and dole out your bread by weight, so that you will eat but not be satisfied. 
03026027	But if in spite of all this you do not obey Me, but continue to walk in hostility toward Me, 
03026028	then I will walk in fury against you, and I, even I, will punish you sevenfold for your sins. 
03026029	You will eat the flesh of your own sons and daughters. 
03026030	I will destroy your high places, cut down your incense altars, and heap your lifeless bodies on the lifeless remains of your idols; and My soul will despise you. 
03026031	I will reduce your cities to rubble and lay waste your sanctuaries, and I will refuse to smell the pleasing aroma of your sacrifices. 
03026032	And I will lay waste the land, so that your enemies who dwell in it will be appalled. 
03026033	But I will scatter you among the nations and will draw out a sword after you as your land becomes desolate and your cities are laid waste. 
03026034	Then the land shall enjoy its Sabbaths all the days it lies desolate, while you are in the land of your enemies. At that time the land will rest and enjoy its Sabbaths. 
03026035	As long as it lies desolate, the land will have the rest it did not receive during the Sabbaths when you lived in it. 
03026036	As for those of you who survive, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies, so that even the sound of a windblown leaf will put them to flight. And they will flee as one flees the sword, and fall when no one pursues them. 
03026037	They will stumble over one another as before the sword, though no one is behind them. So you will not be able to stand against your enemies. 
03026038	You will perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies will consume you. 
03026039	Those of you who survive in the lands of your enemies will waste away in their iniquity and will decay in the sins of their fathers. 
03026040	But if they will confess their iniquity and that of their fathers in the unfaithfulness that they practiced against Me, by which they have also walked in hostility toward Me— 
03026041	and I acted with hostility toward them and brought them into the land of their enemies—and if their uncircumcised hearts will be humbled and they will make amends for their iniquity, 
03026042	then I will remember My covenant with Jacob and My covenant with Isaac and My covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land. 
03026043	For the land will be abandoned by them, and it will enjoy its Sabbaths by lying desolate without them. And they will pay the penalty for their iniquity, because they rejected My ordinances and abhorred My statutes. 
03026044	Yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject or despise them so as to destroy them and break My covenant with them; for I am the LORD their God. 
03026045	But for their sake I will remember the covenant with their fathers, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God. I am the LORD.” 
03026046	These are the statutes, ordinances, and laws that the LORD established between Himself and the Israelites through Moses on Mount Sinai. 
03027001	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
03027002	“Speak to the Israelites and say to them, ‘When someone makes a special vow to the LORD involving the value of persons, 
03027003	if the valuation concerns a male from twenty to sixty years of age, then your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel. 
03027004	Or if it is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels. 
03027005	And if the person is from five to twenty years of age, then your valuation for the male shall be twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels. 
03027006	Now if the person is from one month to five years of age, then your valuation for the male shall be five shekels of silver, and for the female three shekels of silver. 
03027007	And if the person is sixty years of age or older, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels for the male and ten shekels for the female. 
03027008	But if the one making the vow is too poor to pay the valuation, he is to present the person before the priest, who shall set the value according to what the one making the vow can afford. 
03027009	If he vows an animal that may be brought as an offering to the LORD, any such animal given to the LORD shall be holy. 
03027010	He must not replace it or exchange it, either good for bad or bad for good. But if he does substitute one animal for another, both that animal and its substitute will be holy. 
03027011	But if the vow involves any of the unclean animals that may not be brought as an offering to the LORD, the animal must be presented before the priest. 
03027012	The priest shall set its value, whether high or low; as the priest values it, the price will be set. 
03027013	If, however, the owner decides to redeem the animal, he must add a fifth to its value. 
03027014	Now if a man consecrates his house as holy to the LORD, then the priest shall value it either as good or bad. The price will stand just as the priest values it. 
03027015	But if he who consecrated his house redeems it, he must add a fifth to the assessed value, and it will belong to him. 
03027016	If a man consecrates to the LORD a parcel of his land, then your valuation shall be proportional to the seed required for it—fifty shekels of silver for every homer of barley seed. 
03027017	If he consecrates his field during the Year of Jubilee, the price will stand according to your valuation. 
03027018	But if he consecrates his field after the Jubilee, the priest is to calculate the price in proportion to the years left until the next Year of Jubilee, so that your valuation will be reduced. 
03027019	And if the one who consecrated the field decides to redeem it, he must add a fifth to the assessed value, and it shall belong to him. 
03027020	If, however, he does not redeem the field, or if he has sold it to another man, it may no longer be redeemed. 
03027021	When the field is released in the Jubilee, it will become holy, like a field devoted to the LORD; it becomes the property of the priests. 
03027022	Now if a man consecrates to the LORD a field he has purchased, which is not a part of his own property, 
03027023	then the priest shall calculate for him the value up to the Year of Jubilee, and the man shall pay the assessed value on that day as a sacred offering to the LORD. 
03027024	In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to the one from whom it was bought—the original owner of the land. 
03027025	Every valuation will be according to the sanctuary shekel, twenty gerahs to the shekel. 
03027026	But no one may consecrate a firstborn of the livestock, because a firstborn belongs to the LORD. Whether it is an ox or a sheep, it is the LORD’s. 
03027027	But if it is among the unclean animals, then he may redeem it according to your valuation and add a fifth of its value. If it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation. 
03027028	Nothing that a man sets apart to the LORD from all he owns—whether a man, an animal, or his inherited land—can be sold or redeemed; everything so devoted is most holy to the LORD. 
03027029	No person set apart for destruction may be ransomed; he must surely be put to death. 
03027030	Thus any tithe from the land, whether from the seed of the land or the fruit of the trees, belongs to the LORD; it is holy to the LORD. 
03027031	If a man wishes to redeem part of his tithe, he must add a fifth to its value. 
03027032	Every tenth animal from the herd or flock that passes under the shepherd’s rod will be holy to the LORD. 
03027033	He must not inspect whether it is good or bad, and he shall not make any substitution. But if he does make a substitution, both the animal and its substitute shall become holy; they cannot be redeemed.’” 
03027034	These are the commandments that the LORD gave to Moses for the Israelites on Mount Sinai. 
04001001	On the first day of the second month of the second year after the Israelites had come out of the land of Egypt, the LORD spoke to Moses in the Tent of Meeting in the Wilderness of Sinai. He said: 
04001002	“Take a census of the whole congregation of Israel by their clans and families, listing every man by name, one by one. 
04001003	You and Aaron are to number those who are twenty years of age or older by their divisions—everyone who can serve in Israel’s army. 
04001004	And one man from each tribe, the head of each family, must be there with you. 
04001005	These are the names of the men who are to assist you: From the tribe of Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur; 
04001006	from Simeon, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai; 
04001007	from Judah, Nahshon son of Amminadab; 
04001008	from Issachar, Nethanel son of Zuar; 
04001009	from Zebulun, Eliab son of Helon; 
04001010	from the sons of Joseph: from Ephraim, Elishama son of Ammihud, and from Manasseh, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur; 
04001011	from Benjamin, Abidan son of Gideoni; 
04001012	from Dan, Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai; 
04001013	from Asher, Pagiel son of Ocran; 
04001014	from Gad, Eliasaph son of Deuel; 
04001015	and from Naphtali, Ahira son of Enan.” 
04001016	These men were appointed from the congregation; they were the leaders of the tribes of their fathers, the heads of the clans of Israel. 
04001017	So Moses and Aaron took these men who had been designated by name, 
04001018	and on the first day of the second month they assembled the whole congregation and recorded their ancestry by clans and families, counting one by one the names of those twenty years of age or older, 
04001019	just as the LORD had commanded Moses. So Moses numbered them in the Wilderness of Sinai: 
04001020	From the sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, according to the records of their clans and families, counting one by one the names of every male twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army, 
04001021	those registered to the tribe of Reuben numbered 46,500. 
04001022	From the sons of Simeon, according to the records of their clans and families, counting one by one the names of every male twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army, 
04001023	those registered to the tribe of Simeon numbered 59,300. 
04001024	From the sons of Gad, according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of all those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army, 
04001025	those registered to the tribe of Gad numbered 45,650. 
04001026	From the sons of Judah, according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of all those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army, 
04001027	those registered to the tribe of Judah numbered 74,600. 
04001028	From the sons of Issachar, according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of all those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army, 
04001029	those registered to the tribe of Issachar numbered 54,400. 
04001030	From the sons of Zebulun, according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of all those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army, 
04001031	those registered to the tribe of Zebulun numbered 57,400. 
04001032	From the sons of Joseph: From the sons of Ephraim, according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of all those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army, 
04001033	those registered to the tribe of Ephraim numbered 40,500. 
04001034	And from the sons of Manasseh, according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of all those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army, 
04001035	those registered to the tribe of Manasseh numbered 32,200. 
04001036	From the sons of Benjamin, according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of all those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army, 
04001037	those registered to the tribe of Benjamin numbered 35,400. 
04001038	From the sons of Dan, according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of all those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army, 
04001039	those registered to the tribe of Dan numbered 62,700. 
04001040	From the sons of Asher, according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of all those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army, 
04001041	those registered to the tribe of Asher numbered 41,500. 
04001042	From the sons of Naphtali, according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of all those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army, 
04001043	those registered to the tribe of Naphtali numbered 53,400. 
04001044	These were the men numbered by Moses and Aaron, with the assistance of the twelve leaders of Israel, each one representing his family. 
04001045	So all the Israelites twenty years of age or older who could serve in Israel’s army were counted according to their families. 
04001046	And all those counted totaled 603,550. 
04001047	The Levites, however, were not numbered along with them by the tribe of their fathers. 
04001048	For the LORD had said to Moses: 
04001049	“Do not number the tribe of Levi in the census with the other Israelites. 
04001050	Instead, you are to appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the Testimony, all its furnishings, and everything in it. They shall carry the tabernacle and all its articles, care for it, and camp around it. 
04001051	Whenever the tabernacle is to move, the Levites are to take it down, and whenever it is to be pitched, the Levites are to set it up. Any outsider who goes near it must be put to death. 
04001052	The Israelites are to camp by their divisions, each man in his own camp and under his own standard. 
04001053	But the Levites are to camp around the tabernacle of the Testimony and watch over it, so that no wrath will fall on the congregation of Israel. So the Levites are responsible for the tabernacle of the Testimony.” 
04001054	Thus the Israelites did everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
04002001	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron: 
04002002	“The Israelites are to camp around the Tent of Meeting at a distance from it, each man under his standard, with the banners of his family. 
04002003	On the east side, toward the sunrise, the divisions of Judah are to camp under their standard: The leader of the Judahites is Nahshon son of Amminadab, 
04002004	and his division numbers 74,600. 
04002005	The tribe of Issachar will camp next to it. The leader of the Issacharites is Nethanel son of Zuar, 
04002006	and his division numbers 54,400. 
04002007	Next will be the tribe of Zebulun. The leader of the Zebulunites is Eliab son of Helon, 
04002008	and his division numbers 57,400. 
04002009	The total number of men in the divisions of the camp of Judah is 186,400; they shall set out first. 
04002010	On the south side, the divisions of Reuben are to camp under their standard: The leader of the Reubenites is Elizur son of Shedeur, 
04002011	and his division numbers 46,500. 
04002012	The tribe of Simeon will camp next to it. The leader of the Simeonites is Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai, 
04002013	and his division numbers 59,300. 
04002014	Next will be the tribe of Gad. The leader of the Gadites is Eliasaph son of Deuel, 
04002015	and his division numbers 45,650. 
04002016	The total number of men in the divisions of the camp of Reuben is 151,450; they shall set out second. 
04002017	In the middle of the camps, the Tent of Meeting is to travel with the camp of the Levites. They are to set out in the order they encamped, each in his own place under his standard. 
04002018	On the west side, the divisions of Ephraim are to camp under their standard: The leader of the Ephraimites is Elishama son of Ammihud, 
04002019	and his division numbers 40,500. 
04002020	The tribe of Manasseh will be next to it. The leader of the Manassites is Gamaliel son of Pedahzur, 
04002021	and his division numbers 32,200. 
04002022	Next will be the tribe of Benjamin. The leader of the Benjamites is Abidan son of Gideoni, 
04002023	and his division numbers 35,400. 
04002024	The total number of men in the divisions of the camp of Ephraim is 108,100; they shall set out third. 
04002025	On the north side, the divisions of Dan are to camp under their standard: The leader of the Danites is Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai, 
04002026	and his division numbers 62,700. 
04002027	The tribe of Asher will camp next to it. The leader of the Asherites is Pagiel son of Ocran, 
04002028	and his division numbers 41,500. 
04002029	Next will be the tribe of Naphtali. The leader of the Naphtalites is Ahira son of Enan, 
04002030	and his division numbers 53,400. 
04002031	The total number of men in the camp of Dan is 157,600; they shall set out last, under their standards.” 
04002032	These are the Israelites, numbered according to their families. The total of those counted in the camps, by their divisions, was 603,550. 
04002033	But the Levites were not counted among the other Israelites, as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
04002034	So the Israelites did everything the LORD commanded Moses; they camped under their standards in this way and set out in the same way, each man with his clan and his family. 
04003001	This is the account of Aaron and Moses at the time the LORD spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai. 
04003002	These are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, then Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
04003003	These were Aaron’s sons, the anointed priests, who were ordained to serve as priests. 
04003004	Nadab and Abihu, however, died in the presence of the LORD when they offered unauthorized fire before the LORD in the Wilderness of Sinai. And since they had no sons, only Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during the lifetime of their father Aaron. 
04003005	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
04003006	“Bring the tribe of Levi and present them to Aaron the priest to assist him. 
04003007	They are to perform duties for him and for the whole congregation before the Tent of Meeting, attending to the service of the tabernacle. 
04003008	They shall take care of all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting and fulfill obligations for the Israelites by attending to the service of the tabernacle. 
04003009	Assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they have been given exclusively to him from among the Israelites. 
04003010	So you shall appoint Aaron and his sons to carry out the duties of the priesthood; but any outsider who approaches the tabernacle must be put to death.” 
04003011	Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 
04003012	“Behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel in place of every firstborn Israelite from the womb. The Levites belong to Me, 
04003013	for all the firstborn are Mine. On the day I struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, I consecrated to Myself all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast. They are Mine; I am the LORD.” 
04003014	Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, saying, 
04003015	“Number the Levites by their families and clans. You are to count every male a month old or more.” 
04003016	So Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as he had been commanded. 
04003017	These were the sons of Levi by name: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
04003018	These were the names of the sons of Gershon by their clans: Libni and Shimei. 
04003019	The sons of Kohath by their clans were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. 
04003020	And the sons of Merari by their clans were Mahli and Mushi. These were the clans of the Levites, according to their families. 
04003021	From Gershon came the Libnite clan and the Shimeite clan; these were the Gershonite clans. 
04003022	The number of all the males a month old or more was 7,500. 
04003023	The Gershonite clans were to camp on the west, behind the tabernacle, 
04003024	and the leader of the families of the Gershonites was Eliasaph son of Lael. 
04003025	The duties of the Gershonites at the Tent of Meeting were the tabernacle and tent, its covering, the curtain for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, 
04003026	the curtains of the courtyard, the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard that surrounds the tabernacle and altar, and the cords—all the service for these items. 
04003027	From Kohath came the clans of the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites; these were the clans of the Kohathites. 
04003028	The number of all the males a month old or more was 8,600. They were responsible for the duties of the sanctuary. 
04003029	The clans of the Kohathites were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle, 
04003030	and the leader of the families of the Kohathites was Elizaphan son of Uzziel. 
04003031	Their duties were the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the articles of the sanctuary used with them, and the curtain—all the service for these items. 
04003032	The chief of the leaders of the Levites was Eleazar son of Aaron the priest; he oversaw those responsible for the duties of the sanctuary. 
04003033	From Merari came the clans of the Mahlites and Mushites; these were the Merarite clans. 
04003034	The number of all the males a month old or more was 6,200. 
04003035	The leader of the families of the Merarites was Zuriel son of Abihail; they were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle. 
04003036	The duties assigned to the sons of Merari were the tabernacle’s frames, crossbars, posts, bases, and all its equipment—all the service for these items, 
04003037	as well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs, and ropes. 
04003038	Moses, Aaron, and Aaron’s sons were to camp to the east of the tabernacle, toward the sunrise, before the Tent of Meeting. They were to perform the duties of the sanctuary as a service on behalf of the Israelites; but any outsider who approached the sanctuary was to be put to death. 
04003039	The total number of Levites that Moses and Aaron counted by their clans at the LORD’s command, including all the males a month old or more, was 22,000. 
04003040	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Number every firstborn male of the Israelites a month old or more, and list their names. 
04003041	You are to take the Levites for Me—I am the LORD—in place of all the firstborn of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites in place of all the firstborn of the livestock of the Israelites.” 
04003042	So Moses numbered all the firstborn of the Israelites, as the LORD had commanded him. 
04003043	The total number of the firstborn males a month old or more, listed by name, was 22,273. 
04003044	Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 
04003045	“Take the Levites in place of all the firstborn of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites in place of their livestock. The Levites belong to Me; I am the LORD. 
04003046	To redeem the 273 firstborn Israelites who outnumber the Levites, 
04003047	you are to collect five shekels for each one, according to the sanctuary shekel of twenty gerahs. 
04003048	Give the money to Aaron and his sons as the redemption price for the excess among the Israelites.” 
04003049	So Moses collected the redemption money from those in excess of the number redeemed by the Levites. 
04003050	He collected the money from the firstborn of the Israelites: 1,365 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel. 
04003051	And Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons in obedience to the word of the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded him. 
04004001	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 
04004002	“Take a census of the Kohathites among the Levites by their clans and families, 
04004003	men from thirty to fifty years old—everyone who is qualified to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting. 
04004004	This service of the Kohathites at the Tent of Meeting regards the most holy things. 
04004005	Whenever the camp sets out, Aaron and his sons are to go in, take down the veil of the curtain, and cover the ark of the Testimony with it. 
04004006	They are to place over this a covering of fine leather, spread a solid blue cloth over it, and insert its poles. 
04004007	Over the table of the Presence they are to spread a blue cloth and place the plates and cups on it, along with the bowls and pitchers for the drink offering. The regular bread offering is to remain on it. 
04004008	And they shall spread a scarlet cloth over them, cover them with fine leather, and insert the poles. 
04004009	They are to take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand used for light, together with its lamps, wick trimmers, and trays, as well as the jars of oil with which to supply it. 
04004010	Then they shall wrap it and all its utensils inside a covering of fine leather and put it on the carrying frame. 
04004011	Over the gold altar they are to spread a blue cloth, cover it with fine leather, and insert the poles. 
04004012	They are to take all the utensils for serving in the sanctuary, place them in a blue cloth, cover them with fine leather, and put them on the carrying frame. 
04004013	Then they shall remove the ashes from the bronze altar, spread a purple cloth over it, 
04004014	and place on it all the vessels used to serve there: the firepans, meat forks, shovels, and sprinkling bowls—all the equipment of the altar. They are to spread over it a covering of fine leather and insert the poles. 
04004015	When Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy objects and all their equipment, as soon as the camp is ready to move, the Kohathites shall come and do the carrying. But they must not touch the holy objects, or they will die. These are the transportation duties of the Kohathites regarding the Tent of Meeting. 
04004016	Eleazar son of Aaron the priest shall oversee the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the daily grain offering, and the anointing oil. He has oversight of the entire tabernacle and everything in it, including the holy objects and their utensils.” 
04004017	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 
04004018	“Do not allow the Kohathite tribal clans to be cut off from among the Levites. 
04004019	In order that they may live and not die when they come near the most holy things, do this for them: Aaron and his sons are to go in and assign each man his task and what he is to carry. 
04004020	But the Kohathites are not to go in and look at the holy objects, even for a moment, or they will die.” 
04004021	And the LORD said to Moses, 
04004022	“Take a census of the Gershonites as well, by their families and clans, 
04004023	from thirty to fifty years old, counting everyone who comes to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting. 
04004024	This is the service of the Gershonite clans regarding work and transport: 
04004025	They are to carry the curtains of the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting with the covering of fine leather over it, the curtains for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, 
04004026	the curtains of the courtyard, and the curtains for the entrance at the gate of the courtyard that surrounds the tabernacle and altar, along with their ropes and all the equipment for their service. The Gershonites will do all that needs to be done with these items. 
04004027	All the service of the Gershonites—all their transport duties and other work—is to be done at the direction of Aaron and his sons; you are to assign to them all that they are responsible to carry. 
04004028	This is the service of the Gershonite clans at the Tent of Meeting, and their duties shall be under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest. 
04004029	As for the sons of Merari, you are to number them by their clans and families, 
04004030	from thirty to fifty years old, counting everyone who comes to serve in the work of the Tent of Meeting. 
04004031	This is the duty for all their service at the Tent of Meeting: to carry the frames of the tabernacle with its crossbars, posts, and bases, 
04004032	and the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs, and ropes, including all their equipment and everything related to their use. You shall assign by name the items that they are responsible to carry. 
04004033	This is the service of the Merarite clans according to all their work at the Tent of Meeting, under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.” 
04004034	So Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of the congregation numbered the Kohathites by their clans and families, 
04004035	everyone from thirty to fifty years old who came to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting. 
04004036	And those numbered by their clans totaled 2,750. 
04004037	These were counted from the Kohathite clans, everyone who could serve at the Tent of Meeting. Moses and Aaron numbered them according to the command of the LORD through Moses. 
04004038	Then the Gershonites were numbered by their clans and families, 
04004039	everyone from thirty to fifty years old who came to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting. 
04004040	And those numbered by their clans and families totaled 2,630. 
04004041	These were counted from the Gershonite clans who served at the Tent of Meeting, whom Moses and Aaron counted at the LORD’s command. 
04004042	And the Merarites were numbered by their clans and families, 
04004043	everyone from thirty to fifty years old who came to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting. 
04004044	The men registered by their clans numbered 3,200. 
04004045	These were counted from the Merarite clans, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the LORD’s command through Moses. 
04004046	So Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of Israel numbered by their clans and families all the Levites 
04004047	from thirty to fifty years old who came to do the work of serving and carrying the Tent of Meeting. 
04004048	And the number of men was 8,580. 
04004049	At the LORD’s command through Moses they were numbered, and each one was assigned his work and burden, as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
04005001	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
04005002	“Command the Israelites to send away from the camp anyone with a skin disease, anyone who has a bodily discharge, and anyone who is defiled by a dead body. 
04005003	You must send away male and female alike; send them outside the camp so they will not defile their camp, where I dwell among them.” 
04005004	So the Israelites did this, sending such people outside the camp. They did just as the LORD had instructed Moses. 
04005005	And the LORD said to Moses, 
04005006	“Tell the Israelites that when a man or woman acts unfaithfully against the LORD by committing any sin against another, that person is guilty 
04005007	and must confess the sin he has committed. He must make full restitution, add a fifth to its value, and give all this to the one he has wronged. 
04005008	But if the man has no relative to whom restitution can be made for the wrong, the restitution belongs to the LORD and must be given to the priest along with the ram of atonement, by which the atonement is made for him. 
04005009	Every sacred contribution the Israelites bring to the priest shall belong to him. 
04005010	Each man’s sacred gifts are his own, but whatever he gives to the priest will belong to the priest.” 
04005011	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
04005012	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them that if any man’s wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him 
04005013	by sleeping with another man, and it is concealed from her husband and her impurity is undetected (since there is no witness against her and she was not caught in the act), 
04005014	and if a feeling of jealousy comes over her husband and he suspects his wife who has defiled herself—or if a feeling of jealousy comes over him and he suspects her even though she has not defiled herself— 
04005015	then he is to bring his wife to the priest. He must also bring for her an offering of a tenth of an ephah of barley flour. He is not to pour oil over it or put frankincense on it, because it is a grain offering for jealousy, an offering of memorial as a reminder of iniquity. 
04005016	The priest is to bring the wife forward and have her stand before the LORD. 
04005017	Then he is to take some holy water in a clay jar and put some of the dust from the tabernacle floor into the water. 
04005018	After the priest has the woman stand before the LORD, he is to let down her hair and place in her hands the grain offering of memorial, which is the grain offering for jealousy. The priest is to hold the bitter water that brings a curse. 
04005019	And he is to put the woman under oath and say to her, ‘If no other man has slept with you and you have not gone astray and become defiled while under your husband’s authority, may you be immune to this bitter water that brings a curse. 
04005020	But if you have gone astray while under your husband’s authority and have defiled yourself and lain carnally with a man other than your husband’— 
04005021	and the priest shall have the woman swear under the oath of the curse—‘then may the LORD make you an attested curse among your people by making your thigh shrivel and your belly swell. 
04005022	May this water that brings a curse enter your stomach and cause your belly to swell and your thigh to shrivel.’ Then the woman is to say, ‘Amen, Amen.’ 
04005023	And the priest shall write these curses on a scroll and wash them off into the bitter water. 
04005024	He is to have the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and it will enter her and may cause her bitter suffering. 
04005025	The priest shall take from her hand the grain offering for jealousy, wave it before the LORD, and bring it to the altar. 
04005026	Then the priest is to take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial portion and burn it on the altar; after that he is to have the woman drink the water. 
04005027	When he has made her drink the water, if she has defiled herself and been unfaithful to her husband, then the water that brings a curse will enter her and cause bitter suffering; her belly will swell, her thigh will shrivel, and she will become accursed among her people. 
04005028	But if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, she will be unaffected and able to conceive children. 
04005029	This is the law of jealousy when a wife goes astray and defiles herself while under her husband’s authority, 
04005030	or when a feeling of jealousy comes over a husband and he suspects his wife. He is to have the woman stand before the LORD, and the priest is to apply to her this entire law. 
04005031	The husband will be free from guilt, but the woman shall bear her iniquity.” 
04006001	And the LORD said to Moses, 
04006002	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them that if a man or woman makes a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself to the LORD, 
04006003	he is to abstain from wine and strong drink. He must not drink vinegar made from wine or strong drink, and he must not drink any grape juice or eat fresh grapes or raisins. 
04006004	All the days of his separation, he is not to eat anything that comes from the grapevine, not even the seeds or skins. 
04006005	For the entire period of his vow of separation, no razor shall touch his head. He must be holy until the time of his separation to the LORD is complete; he must let the hair of his head grow long. 
04006006	Throughout the days of his separation to the LORD, he must not go near a dead body. 
04006007	Even if his father or mother or brother or sister should die, he is not to defile himself, because the symbol of consecration to his God is upon his head. 
04006008	Throughout the time of his separation, he is holy to the LORD. 
04006009	If someone suddenly dies in his presence and defiles his consecrated head of hair, he must shave his head on the day of his cleansing—the seventh day. 
04006010	On the eighth day he must bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 
04006011	And the priest is to offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to make atonement for him, because he has sinned by being in the presence of the dead body. On that day he must consecrate his head again. 
04006012	He must rededicate his time of separation to the LORD and bring a year-old male lamb as a guilt offering. But the preceding days shall not be counted, because his separation was defiled. 
04006013	Now this is the law of the Nazirite when his time of separation is complete: He must be brought to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, 
04006014	and he is to present an offering to the LORD of an unblemished year-old male lamb as a burnt offering, an unblemished year-old female lamb as a sin offering, and an unblemished ram as a peace offering— 
04006015	together with their grain offerings and drink offerings—and a basket of unleavened cakes made from fine flour mixed with oil and unleavened wafers coated with oil. 
04006016	The priest is to present all these before the LORD and make the sin offering and the burnt offering. 
04006017	He shall also offer the ram as a peace offering to the LORD, along with the basket of unleavened bread. And the priest is to offer the accompanying grain offering and drink offering. 
04006018	Then at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the Nazirite is to shave his consecrated head, take the hair, and put it on the fire under the peace offering. 
04006019	And the priest is to take the boiled shoulder from the ram, one unleavened cake from the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and put them into the hands of the Nazirite who has just shaved the hair of his consecration. 
04006020	The priest shall then wave them as a wave offering before the LORD. This is a holy portion for the priest, in addition to the breast of the wave offering and the thigh that was presented. After that, the Nazirite may drink wine. 
04006021	This is the law of the Nazirite who vows his offering to the LORD for his separation, in addition to whatever else he can afford; he must fulfill whatever vow he makes, according to the law of his separation.” 
04006022	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
04006023	“Tell Aaron and his sons: This is how you are to bless the Israelites. Say to them: 
04006024	‘May the LORD bless you and keep you; 
04006025	may the LORD cause His face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; 
04006026	may the LORD lift up His countenance toward you and give you peace.’ 
04006027	So they shall put My name on the Israelites, and I will bless them.” 
04007001	On the day Moses finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated it and all its furnishings, along with the altar and all its utensils. 
04007002	And the leaders of Israel, the heads of their families, presented an offering. These men were the tribal leaders who had supervised the registration. 
04007003	They brought as their offering before the LORD six covered carts and twelve oxen—an ox from each leader and a cart from every two leaders—and presented them before the tabernacle. 
04007004	And the LORD said to Moses, 
04007005	“Accept these gifts from them, that they may be used in the work of the Tent of Meeting. And give them to the Levites, to each man according to his service.” 
04007006	So Moses took the carts and oxen and gave them to the Levites. 
04007007	He gave the Gershonites two carts and four oxen, as their service required, 
04007008	and he gave the Merarites four carts and eight oxen, as their service required, all under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest. 
04007009	But he did not give any to the Kohathites, since they were to carry on their shoulders the holy objects for which they were responsible. 
04007010	When the altar was anointed, the leaders approached with their offerings for its dedication and presented them before the altar. 
04007011	And the LORD said to Moses, “Each day one leader is to present his offering for the dedication of the altar.” 
04007012	On the first day Nahshon son of Amminadab from the tribe of Judah drew near with his offering. 
04007013	His offering was one silver platter weighing a hundred and thirty shekels, and one silver bowl weighing seventy shekels, both according to the sanctuary shekel and filled with fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering; 
04007014	one gold dish weighing ten shekels, filled with incense; 
04007015	one young bull, one ram, and one male lamb a year old for a burnt offering; 
04007016	one male goat for a sin offering; 
04007017	and a peace offering of two oxen, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs a year old. This was the offering of Nahshon son of Amminadab. 
04007018	On the second day Nethanel son of Zuar, the leader of Issachar, drew near.

04007073	His offering was one silver platter weighing a hundred and thirty shekels, and one silver bowl weighing seventy shekels, both according to the sanctuary shekel and filled with fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering; 
04007074	one gold dish weighing ten shekels, filled with incense; 
04007075	one young bull, one ram, and one male lamb a year old for a burnt offering; 
04007076	one male goat for a sin offering; 
04007077	and a peace offering of two oxen, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs a year old. This was the offering of Pagiel son of Ocran. 
04007078	On the twelfth day Ahira son of Enan, the leader of the Naphtalites, drew near. 
04007079	His offering was one silver platter weighing a hundred and thirty shekels, and one silver bowl weighing seventy shekels, both according to the sanctuary shekel and filled with fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering; 
04007080	one gold dish weighing ten shekels, filled with incense; 
04007081	one young bull, one ram, and one male lamb a year old for a burnt offering; 
04007082	one male goat for a sin offering; 
04007083	and a peace offering of two oxen, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs a year old. This was the offering of Ahira son of Enan. 
04007084	So these were the offerings from the leaders of Israel for the dedication of the altar when it was anointed: twelve silver platters, twelve silver bowls, and twelve gold dishes. 
04007085	Each silver platter weighed a hundred and thirty shekels, and each silver bowl seventy shekels. The total weight of the silver articles was two thousand four hundred shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel. 
04007086	The twelve gold dishes filled with incense weighed ten shekels each, according to the sanctuary shekel. The total weight of the gold dishes was a hundred and twenty shekels. 
04007087	All the livestock for the burnt offering totaled twelve bulls, twelve rams, and twelve male lambs a year old—together with their grain offerings—and twelve male goats for the sin offering. 
04007088	All the livestock sacrificed for the peace offering totaled twenty-four bulls, sixty rams, sixty male goats, and sixty male lambs a year old. This was the dedication offering for the altar after it was anointed. 
04007089	When Moses entered the Tent of Meeting to speak with the LORD, he heard the voice speaking to him from between the two cherubim above the mercy seat on the ark of the Testimony. Thus the LORD spoke to him. 
04008001	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
04008002	“Speak to Aaron and tell him: ‘When you set up the seven lamps, they are to light the area in front of the lampstand.’” 
04008003	And Aaron did so; he set up the lamps facing toward the front of the lampstand, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
04008004	This is how the lampstand was constructed: it was made of hammered gold from its base to its blossoms, fashioned according to the pattern the LORD had shown Moses. 
04008005	Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 
04008006	“Take the Levites from among the Israelites and make them ceremonially clean. 
04008007	This is what you must do to cleanse them: Sprinkle them with the water of purification. Have them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes, and so purify themselves. 
04008008	Then have them take a young bull with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you are to take a second young bull for a sin offering. 
04008009	Bring the Levites before the Tent of Meeting and assemble the whole congregation of Israel. 
04008010	You are to present the Levites before the LORD and have the Israelites lay their hands upon them. 
04008011	Aaron is to present the Levites before the LORD as a wave offering from the sons of Israel, so that they may perform the service of the LORD. 
04008012	And the Levites are to lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, and offer to the LORD one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, to make atonement for the Levites. 
04008013	You are to have the Levites stand before Aaron and his sons and then present them before the LORD as a wave offering. 
04008014	In this way you shall separate the Levites from the rest of the Israelites, and the Levites will belong to Me. 
04008015	After you have cleansed them and presented them as a wave offering, they may come to serve at the Tent of Meeting. 
04008016	For the Levites have been wholly given to Me from among the sons of Israel. I have taken them for Myself in place of all who come first from the womb, the firstborn of all the sons of Israel. 
04008017	For every firstborn male in Israel is Mine, both man and beast. I set them apart for Myself on the day I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt. 
04008018	But I have taken the Levites in place of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel. 
04008019	And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the Israelites, to perform the service for the Israelites at the Tent of Meeting and to make atonement on their behalf, so that no plague will come against the Israelites when they approach the sanctuary.” 
04008020	So Moses, Aaron, and the whole congregation of Israel did with the Levites everything that the LORD had commanded Moses they should do. 
04008021	The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes, and Aaron presented them as a wave offering before the LORD. Aaron also made atonement for them to cleanse them. 
04008022	After that, the Levites came to perform their service at the Tent of Meeting in the presence of Aaron and his sons. Thus they did with the Levites just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
04008023	And the LORD said to Moses, 
04008024	“This applies to the Levites: Men twenty-five years of age or older shall enter to perform the service in the work at the Tent of Meeting. 
04008025	But at the age of fifty, they must retire from performing the work and no longer serve. 
04008026	After that, they may assist their brothers in fulfilling their duties at the Tent of Meeting, but they themselves are not to do the work. This is how you are to assign responsibilities to the Levites.” 
04009001	In the first month of the second year after Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, the LORD spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai: 
04009002	“The Israelites are to observe the Passover at its appointed time. 
04009003	You are to observe it at the appointed time, at twilight on the fourteenth day of this month, in accordance with its statutes and ordinances.” 
04009004	So Moses told the Israelites to observe the Passover, 
04009005	and they did so in the Wilderness of Sinai, at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month. The Israelites did everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
04009006	But there were some men who were unclean due to a dead body, so they could not observe the Passover on that day. And they came before Moses and Aaron that same day 
04009007	and said to Moses, “We are unclean because of a dead body, but why should we be excluded from presenting the LORD’s offering with the other Israelites at the appointed time?” 
04009008	“Wait here until I find out what the LORD commands concerning you,” Moses replied. 
04009009	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
04009010	“Tell the Israelites: ‘When any one of you or your descendants is unclean because of a dead body, or is away on a journey, he may still observe the Passover to the LORD. 
04009011	Such people are to observe it at twilight on the fourteenth day of the second month. They are to eat the lamb, together with unleavened bread and bitter herbs; 
04009012	they may not leave any of it until morning or break any of its bones. They must observe the Passover according to all its statutes. 
04009013	But if a man who is ceremonially clean and is not on a journey still fails to observe the Passover, he must be cut off from his people, because he did not present the LORD’s offering at its appointed time. That man will bear the consequences of his sin. 
04009014	If a foreigner dwelling among you wants to observe the Passover to the LORD, he is to do so according to the Passover statute and its ordinances. You are to apply the same statute to both the foreigner and the native of the land.’” 
04009015	On the day that the tabernacle, the Tent of the Testimony, was set up, the cloud covered it and appeared like fire above the tabernacle from evening until morning. 
04009016	It remained that way continually; the cloud would cover the tabernacle by day, and at night it would appear like fire. 
04009017	Whenever the cloud was lifted from above the Tent, the Israelites would set out, and wherever the cloud settled, there the Israelites would camp. 
04009018	At the LORD’s command the Israelites set out, and at the LORD’s command they camped. As long as the cloud remained over the tabernacle, they remained encamped. 
04009019	Even when the cloud lingered over the tabernacle for many days, the Israelites kept the LORD’s charge and did not set out. 
04009020	Sometimes the cloud remained over the tabernacle for only a few days, and they would camp at the LORD’s command and set out at the LORD’s command. 
04009021	Sometimes the cloud remained only from evening until morning, and when it lifted in the morning, they would set out. Whether it was by day or by night, when the cloud was taken up, they would set out. 
04009022	Whether the cloud lingered for two days, a month, or longer, the Israelites camped and did not set out as long as the cloud remained over the tabernacle; but when it was lifted, they would set out. 
04009023	They camped at the LORD’s command, and they set out at the LORD’s command; they carried out the LORD’s charge according to His command through Moses. 
04010001	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
04010002	“Make two trumpets of hammered silver to be used for calling the congregation and for having the camps set out. 
04010003	When both are sounded, the whole congregation is to assemble before you at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 
04010004	But if only one is sounded, then the leaders, the heads of the clans of Israel, are to gather before you. 
04010005	When you sound short blasts, the camps that lie on the east side are to set out. 
04010006	When you sound the short blasts a second time, the camps that lie on the south side are to set out. The blasts are to signal them to set out. 
04010007	To convene the assembly, you are to sound long blasts, not short ones. 
04010008	The sons of Aaron, the priests, are to sound the trumpets. This shall be a permanent statute for you and the generations to come. 
04010009	When you enter into battle in your land against an adversary who attacks you, sound short blasts on the trumpets, and you will be remembered before the LORD your God and saved from your enemies. 
04010010	And on your joyous occasions, your appointed feasts, and the beginning of each month, you are to blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and peace offerings to serve as a reminder for you before your God. I am the LORD your God.” 
04010011	On the twentieth day of the second month of the second year, the cloud was lifted from above the tabernacle of the Testimony, 
04010012	and the Israelites set out from the Wilderness of Sinai, traveling from place to place until the cloud settled in the Wilderness of Paran. 
04010013	They set out this first time according to the LORD’s command through Moses. 
04010014	First, the divisions of the camp of Judah set out under their standard, with Nahshon son of Amminadab in command. 
04010015	Nethanel son of Zuar was over the division of the tribe of Issachar, 
04010016	and Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the tribe of Zebulun. 
04010017	Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonites and the Merarites set out, transporting it. 
04010018	Then the divisions of the camp of Reuben set out under their standard, with Elizur son of Shedeur in command. 
04010019	Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over the division of the tribe of Simeon, 
04010020	and Eliasaph son of Deuel was over the division of the tribe of Gad. 
04010021	Then the Kohathites set out, transporting the holy objects; the tabernacle was to be set up before their arrival. 
04010022	Next, the divisions of the camp of Ephraim set out under their standard, with Elishama son of Ammihud in command. 
04010023	Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh, 
04010024	and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin. 
04010025	Finally, the divisions of the camp of Dan set out under their standard, serving as the rear guard for all units, with Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai in command. 
04010026	Pagiel son of Ocran was over the division of the tribe of Asher, 
04010027	and Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali. 
04010028	This was the order of march for the Israelite divisions as they set out. 
04010029	Then Moses said to Hobab, the son of Moses’ father-in-law Reuel the Midianite, “We are setting out for the place of which the LORD said: ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us, and we will treat you well, for the LORD has promised good things to Israel.” 
04010030	“I will not go,” Hobab replied. “Instead, I am going back to my own land and my own people.” 
04010031	“Please do not leave us,” Moses said, “since you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can serve as our eyes. 
04010032	If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good things the LORD gives us.” 
04010033	So they set out on a three-day journey from the mountain of the LORD, with the ark of the covenant of the LORD traveling ahead of them for those three days to seek a resting place for them. 
04010034	And the cloud of the LORD was over them by day when they set out from the camp. 
04010035	Whenever the ark set out, Moses would say, “Rise up, O LORD! May Your enemies be scattered; may those who hate You flee before You.” 
04010036	And when it came to rest, he would say: “Return, O LORD, to the countless thousands of Israel.” 
04011001	Soon the people began to complain about their hardship in the hearing of the LORD, and when He heard them, His anger was kindled, and fire from the LORD blazed among them and consumed the outskirts of the camp. 
04011002	And the people cried out to Moses, and he prayed to the LORD, and the fire died down. 
04011003	So that place was called Taberah, because the fire of the LORD had burned among them. 
04011004	Meanwhile, the rabble among them had a strong craving for other food, and again the Israelites wept and said, “Who will feed us meat? 
04011005	We remember the fish we ate freely in Egypt, along with the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic. 
04011006	But now our appetite is gone; there is nothing to see but this manna!” 
04011007	Now the manna resembled coriander seed, and its appearance was like that of gum resin. 
04011008	The people walked around and gathered it, ground it on a handmill or crushed it in a mortar, then boiled it in a cooking pot or shaped it into cakes. It tasted like pastry baked with fine oil. 
04011009	When the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna would fall with it. 
04011010	Then Moses heard the people of family after family weeping at the entrances to their tents, and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly, and Moses was also displeased. 
04011011	So Moses asked the LORD, “Why have You brought this trouble on Your servant? Why have I not found favor in Your sight, that You have laid upon me the burden of all these people? 
04011012	Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth, so that You should tell me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries an infant,’ to the land that You swore to give their fathers? 
04011013	Where can I get meat for all these people? For they keep crying out to me, ‘Give us meat to eat!’ 
04011014	I cannot carry all these people by myself; it is too burdensome for me. 
04011015	If this is how You are going to treat me, please kill me right now—if I have found favor in Your eyes—and let me not see my own wretchedness.” 
04011016	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Bring Me seventy of the elders of Israel known to you as leaders and officers of the people. Bring them to the Tent of Meeting and have them stand there with you. 
04011017	And I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take some of the Spirit that is on you and put that Spirit on them. They will help you bear the burden of the people, so that you do not have to bear it by yourself. 
04011018	And say to the people: Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you will eat meat, because you have cried out in the hearing of the LORD, saying: ‘Who will feed us meat? For we were better off in Egypt!’ Therefore the LORD will give you meat, and you will eat. 
04011019	You will eat it not for one or two days, nor for five or ten or twenty days, 
04011020	but for a whole month—until it comes out of your nostrils and makes you nauseous—because you have rejected the LORD, who is among you, and have cried out before Him, saying, ‘Why did we ever leave Egypt?’” 
04011021	But Moses replied, “Here I am among 600,000 men on foot, yet You say, ‘I will give them meat, and they will eat for a month.’ 
04011022	If all our flocks and herds were slaughtered for them, would they have enough? Or if all the fish in the sea were caught for them, would they have enough?” 
04011023	The LORD answered Moses, “Is the LORD’s arm too short? Now you will see whether or not My word will come to pass.” 
04011024	So Moses went out and relayed to the people the words of the LORD, and he gathered seventy of the elders of the people and had them stand around the tent. 
04011025	Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and He took some of the Spirit that was on Moses and placed that Spirit on the seventy elders. As the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied—but they never did so again. 
04011026	Two men, however, had remained in the camp—one named Eldad and the other Medad—and the Spirit rested on them. They were among those listed, but they had not gone out to the tent, and they prophesied in the camp. 
04011027	A young man ran and reported to Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.” 
04011028	Joshua son of Nun, the attendant to Moses since youth, spoke up and said, “Moses, my lord, stop them!” 
04011029	But Moses replied, “Are you jealous on my account? I wish that all the LORD’s people were prophets and that the LORD would place His Spirit on them!” 
04011030	Then Moses returned to the camp, along with the elders of Israel. 
04011031	Now a wind sent by the LORD came up, drove in quail from the sea, and brought them near the camp, about two cubits above the surface of the ground, for a day’s journey in every direction around the camp. 
04011032	All that day and night, and all the next day, the people stayed up gathering the quail. No one gathered less than ten homers, and they spread them out all around the camp. 
04011033	But while the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of the LORD burned against the people, and the LORD struck them with a severe plague. 
04011034	So they called that place Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had craved other food. 
04011035	From Kibroth-hattaavah the people moved on to Hazeroth, where they remained for some time. 
04012001	Then Miriam and Aaron criticized Moses because of the Cushite woman he had married, for he had taken a Cushite wife. 
04012002	“Does the LORD speak only through Moses?” they said. “Does He not also speak through us?” And the LORD heard this. 
04012003	Now Moses was a very humble man, more so than any man on the face of the earth. 
04012004	And suddenly the LORD said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, “You three, come out to the Tent of Meeting.” So the three went out, 
04012005	and the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud, stood at the entrance to the Tent, and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When both of them had stepped forward, 
04012006	He said, “Hear now My words: If there is a prophet among you, I, the LORD, will reveal Myself to him in a vision; I will speak to him in a dream. 
04012007	But this is not so with My servant Moses; he is faithful in all My house. 
04012008	I speak with him face to face, clearly and not in riddles; he sees the form of the LORD. Why then were you unafraid to speak against My servant Moses?” 
04012009	So the anger of the LORD burned against them, and He departed. 
04012010	As the cloud lifted from above the Tent, suddenly Miriam became leprous, white as snow. Aaron turned toward her, saw that she was leprous, 
04012011	and said to Moses, “My lord, please do not hold against us this sin we have so foolishly committed. 
04012012	Please do not let her be like a stillborn infant whose flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother’s womb.” 
04012013	So Moses cried out to the LORD, “O God, please heal her!” 
04012014	But the LORD answered Moses, “If her father had but spit in her face, would she not have been in disgrace for seven days? Let her be confined outside the camp for seven days; after that she may be brought back in.” 
04012015	So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on until she was brought in again. 
04012016	After that, the people set out from Hazeroth and camped in the Wilderness of Paran. 
04013001	And the LORD said to Moses, 
04013002	“Send out for yourself men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites. From each of their fathers’ tribes send one man who is a leader among them.” 
04013003	So at the command of the LORD, Moses sent them out from the Wilderness of Paran. All the men were leaders of the Israelites, 
04013004	and these were their names: From the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur; 
04013005	from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori; 
04013006	from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh; 
04013007	from the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph; 
04013008	from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun; 
04013009	from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu; 
04013010	from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi; 
04013011	from the tribe of Manasseh (a tribe of Joseph), Gaddi son of Susi; 
04013012	from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli; 
04013013	from the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael; 
04013014	from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi; 
04013015	and from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Machi. 
04013016	These were the names of the men Moses sent to spy out the land; and Moses gave to Hoshea son of Nun the name Joshua. 
04013017	When Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, he told them, “Go up through the Negev and into the hill country. 
04013018	See what the land is like and whether its people are strong or weak, few or many. 
04013019	Is the land where they live good or bad? Are the cities where they dwell open camps or fortifications? 
04013020	Is the soil fertile or unproductive? Are there trees in it or not? Be courageous and bring back some of the fruit of the land.” (It was the season for the first ripe grapes.) 
04013021	So they went up and spied out the land from the Wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob, toward Lebo-hamath. 
04013022	They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, dwelled. It had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt. 
04013023	When they came to the Valley of Eshcol, they cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes, which they carried on a pole between two men. They also took some pomegranates and figs. 
04013024	Because of the cluster of grapes the Israelites cut there, that place was called the Valley of Eshcol. 
04013025	After forty days the men returned from spying out the land, 
04013026	and they went back to Moses, Aaron, and the whole congregation of Israel in the Wilderness of Paran at Kadesh. They brought back a report for the whole congregation and showed them the fruit of the land. 
04013027	And they gave this account to Moses: “We went into the land to which you sent us, and indeed, it is flowing with milk and honey. Here is some of its fruit! 
04013028	Nevertheless, the people living in the land are strong, and the cities are large and fortified. We even saw the descendants of Anak there. 
04013029	The Amalekites live in the land of the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live by the sea and along the Jordan.” 
04013030	Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, “We must go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly conquer it!” 
04013031	But the men who had gone up with him replied, “We cannot go up against the people, for they are stronger than we are!” 
04013032	So they gave the Israelites a bad report about the land that they had spied out: “The land we explored devours its inhabitants, and all the people we saw there are great in stature. 
04013033	We even saw the Nephilim there—the descendants of Anak that come from the Nephilim! We seemed like grasshoppers in our own sight, and we must have seemed the same to them!” 
04014001	Then the whole congregation lifted up their voices and cried out, and that night the people wept. 
04014002	All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron, and the whole congregation said to them, “If only we had died in the land of Egypt, or if only we had died in this wilderness! 
04014003	Why is the LORD bringing us into this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and children will become plunder. Would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?” 
04014004	So they said to one another, “Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt.” 
04014005	Then Moses and Aaron fell facedown before the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel. 
04014006	Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes 
04014007	and said to the whole congregation of Israel, “The land we passed through and explored is an exceedingly good land. 
04014008	If the LORD delights in us, He will bring us into this land, a land flowing with milk and honey, and He will give it to us. 
04014009	Only do not rebel against the LORD, and do not be afraid of the people of the land, for they will be like bread for us. Their protection has been removed, and the LORD is with us. Do not be afraid of them!” 
04014010	But the whole congregation threatened to stone Joshua and Caleb. Then the glory of the LORD appeared to all the Israelites at the Tent of Meeting. 
04014011	And the LORD said to Moses, “How long will this people treat Me with contempt? How long will they refuse to believe in Me, despite all the signs I have performed among them? 
04014012	I will strike them with a plague and destroy them—and I will make you into a nation greater and mightier than they are.” 
04014013	But Moses said to the LORD, “The Egyptians will hear of it, for by Your strength You brought this people from among them. 
04014014	And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have already heard that You, O LORD, are in the midst of this people, that You, O LORD, have been seen face to face, that Your cloud stands over them, and that You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. 
04014015	If You kill this people as one man, the nations who have heard of Your fame will say, 
04014016	‘Because the LORD was unable to bring this people into the land He swore to give them, He has slaughtered them in the wilderness.’ 
04014017	So now I pray, may the power of my Lord be magnified, just as You have declared: 
04014018	‘The LORD is slow to anger and abounding in loving devotion, forgiving iniquity and transgression. Yet He will by no means leave the guilty unpunished; He will visit the iniquity of the fathers upon their children to the third and fourth generation.’ 
04014019	Pardon, I pray, the iniquity of this people, in keeping with the greatness of Your loving devotion, just as You have forgiven them ever since they left Egypt.” 
04014020	“I have pardoned them as you requested,” the LORD replied. 
04014021	“Yet as surely as I live and as surely as the whole earth is filled with the glory of the LORD, 
04014022	not one of the men who have seen My glory and the signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness—yet have tested Me and disobeyed Me these ten times— 
04014023	not one will ever see the land that I swore to give their fathers. None of those who have treated Me with contempt will see it. 
04014024	But because My servant Caleb has a different spirit and has followed Me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he has entered, and his descendants will inherit it. 
04014025	Now since the Amalekites and Canaanites are living in the valleys, turn back tomorrow and head for the wilderness along the route to the Red Sea.” 
04014026	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 
04014027	“How long will this wicked congregation grumble against Me? I have heard the complaints that the Israelites are making against Me. 
04014028	So tell them: As surely as I live, declares the LORD, I will do to you exactly as I heard you say. 
04014029	Your bodies will fall in this wilderness—all who were numbered in the census, everyone twenty years of age or older—because you have grumbled against Me. 
04014030	Surely none of you will enter the land in which I swore to settle you, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun. 
04014031	But I will bring your children, whom you said would become plunder, into the land you have rejected—and they will enjoy it. 
04014032	As for you, however, your bodies will fall in this wilderness. 
04014033	Your children will be shepherds in the wilderness for forty years, and they will suffer for your unfaithfulness until the last of your bodies lies in the wilderness. 
04014034	In keeping with the forty days you spied out the land, you shall bear your guilt forty years—a year for each day—and you will experience My alienation. 
04014035	I, the LORD, have spoken, and I will surely do these things to this entire wicked congregation, which has conspired against Me. They will meet their end in the wilderness, and there they will die.” 
04014036	So the men Moses had sent to spy out the land, who had returned and made the whole congregation grumble against him by bringing out a bad report about the land— 
04014037	those men who had brought out the bad report about the land—were struck down by a plague before the LORD. 
04014038	Of those men who had gone to spy out the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh remained alive. 
04014039	And when Moses relayed these words to all the Israelites, the people mourned bitterly. 
04014040	Early the next morning they got up and went up toward the ridge of the hill country. “We have indeed sinned,” they said, “but we will go to the place the LORD has promised.” 
04014041	But Moses said, “Why are you transgressing the commandment of the LORD? This will not succeed! 
04014042	Do not go up, lest you be struck down by your enemies, because the LORD is not among you. 
04014043	For there the Amalekites and Canaanites will face you, and you will fall by the sword. Because you have turned away from the LORD, He will not be with you.” 
04014044	But they dared to go up to the ridge of the hill country, though neither Moses nor the ark of the covenant of the LORD moved from the camp. 
04014045	Then the Amalekites and Canaanites who lived in that part of the hill country came down, attacked them, and routed them all the way to Hormah. 
04015001	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
04015002	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: After you enter the land that I am giving you as a home 
04015003	and you present a food offering to the LORD from the herd or flock to produce a pleasing aroma to the LORD—either a burnt offering or a sacrifice, for a special vow or freewill offering or appointed feast— 
04015004	then the one presenting his offering to the LORD shall also present a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a quarter hin of olive oil. 
04015005	With the burnt offering or sacrifice of each lamb, you are to prepare a quarter hin of wine as a drink offering. 
04015006	With a ram you are to prepare a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of olive oil, 
04015007	and a third of a hin of wine as a drink offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. 
04015008	When you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering or sacrifice to fulfill a vow or as a peace offering to the LORD, 
04015009	present with the bull a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of olive oil. 
04015010	Also present half a hin of wine as a drink offering. It is a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. 
04015011	This is to be done for each bull, ram, lamb, or goat. 
04015012	This is how you must prepare each one, no matter how many. 
04015013	Everyone who is native-born shall prepare these things in this way when he presents a food offering as a pleasing aroma to the LORD. 
04015014	And for the generations to come, if a foreigner residing with you or someone else among you wants to prepare a food offering as a pleasing aroma to the LORD, he is to do exactly as you do. 
04015015	The assembly is to have the same statute both for you and for the foreign resident; it is a permanent statute for the generations to come. You and the foreigner shall be the same before the LORD. 
04015016	The same law and the same ordinance will apply both to you and to the foreigner residing with you.” 
04015017	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
04015018	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When you enter the land to which I am bringing you 
04015019	and you eat the food of the land, you shall lift up an offering to the LORD. 
04015020	From the first of your dough, you are to lift up a cake as a contribution; offer it just like an offering from the threshing floor. 
04015021	Throughout your generations, you are to give the LORD an offering from the first of your dough. 
04015022	Now if you stray unintentionally and do not obey all these commandments that the LORD has spoken to Moses— 
04015023	all that the LORD has commanded you through Moses from the day the LORD gave them and continuing through the generations to come— 
04015024	and if it was done unintentionally without the knowledge of the congregation, then the whole congregation is to prepare one young bull as a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD, with its grain offering and drink offering according to the regulation, and one male goat as a sin offering. 
04015025	The priest is to make atonement for the whole congregation of Israel, so that they may be forgiven; for the sin was unintentional and they have brought to the LORD a food offering and a sin offering, presented before the LORD for their unintentional sin. 
04015026	Then the whole congregation of Israel and the foreigners residing among them will be forgiven, since it happened to all the people unintentionally. 
04015027	Also, if one person sins unintentionally, he is to present a year-old female goat as a sin offering. 
04015028	And the priest shall make atonement before the LORD on behalf of the person who erred by sinning unintentionally; and when atonement has been made for him, he will be forgiven. 
04015029	You shall have the same law for the one who acts in error, whether he is a native-born Israelite or a foreigner residing among you. 
04015030	But the person who sins defiantly, whether a native or foreigner, blasphemes the LORD. That person shall be cut off from among his people. 
04015031	He shall certainly be cut off, because he has despised the word of the LORD and broken His commandment; his guilt remains on him.” 
04015032	While the Israelites were in the wilderness, a man was found gathering wood on the Sabbath day. 
04015033	Those who found the man gathering wood brought him to Moses, Aaron, and the whole congregation, 
04015034	and because it had not been declared what should be done to him, they placed him in custody. 
04015035	And the LORD said to Moses, “The man must surely be put to death. The whole congregation is to stone him outside the camp.” 
04015036	So the whole congregation took the man outside the camp and stoned him to death, as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
04015037	And the LORD said to Moses, 
04015038	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them that throughout the generations to come they are to make for themselves tassels for the corners of their garments, with a blue cord on each tassel. 
04015039	These will serve as tassels for you to look at, so that you may remember all the commandments of the LORD, that you may obey them and not prostitute yourselves by following your own heart and your own eyes. 
04015040	Then you will remember and obey all My commandments, and you will be holy to your God. 
04015041	I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am the LORD your God.” 
04016001	Now Korah son of Izhar, the son of Kohath son of Levi, along with some Reubenites—Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth—conducted 
04016002	a rebellion against Moses, along with 250 men of Israel renowned as leaders of the congregation and representatives in the assembly. 
04016003	They came together against Moses and Aaron and told them, “You have taken too much upon yourselves! For everyone in the entire congregation is holy, and the LORD is in their midst. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?” 
04016004	When Moses heard this, he fell facedown. 
04016005	Then he said to Korah and all his followers, “Tomorrow morning the LORD will reveal who belongs to Him and who is holy, and He will bring that person near to Himself. The one He chooses He will bring near to Himself. 
04016006	You, Korah, and all your followers are to do as follows: Take censers, 
04016007	and tomorrow you are to place fire and incense in them in the presence of the LORD. Then the man the LORD chooses will be the one who is holy. It is you sons of Levi who have taken too much upon yourselves!” 
04016008	Moses also said to Korah, “Now listen, you sons of Levi! 
04016009	Is it not enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel and brought you near to Himself to perform the work at the LORD’s tabernacle, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them? 
04016010	He has brought you near, you and all your fellow Levites, but you are seeking the priesthood as well. 
04016011	Therefore, it is you and all your followers who have conspired against the LORD! As for Aaron, who is he that you should grumble against him?” 
04016012	Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, but they said, “We will not come! 
04016013	Is it not enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness? Must you also appoint yourself as ruler over us? 
04016014	Moreover, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? No, we will not come!” 
04016015	Then Moses became very angry and said to the LORD, “Do not regard their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them or mistreated a single one of them.” 
04016016	And Moses said to Korah, “You and all your followers are to appear before the LORD tomorrow—you and they and Aaron. 
04016017	Each man is to take his censer, place incense in it, and present it before the LORD—250 censers. You and Aaron are to present your censers as well.” 
04016018	So each man took his censer, put fire and incense in it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 
04016019	When Korah had gathered his whole assembly against them at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the glory of the LORD appeared to the whole congregation. 
04016020	And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 
04016021	“Separate yourselves from this congregation so that I may consume them in an instant.” 
04016022	But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and said, “O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, when one man sins, will You be angry with the whole congregation?” 
04016023	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
04016024	“Tell the congregation to move away from the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.” 
04016025	So Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him. 
04016026	And he warned the congregation, “Move away now from the tents of these wicked men. Do not touch anything that belongs to them, or you will be swept away because of all their sins.” 
04016027	So they moved away from the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Meanwhile, Dathan and Abiram had come out and stood at the entrances to their tents with their wives and children and infants. 
04016028	Then Moses said, “This is how you will know that the LORD has sent me to do all these things, for it was not my own doing: 
04016029	If these men die a natural death, or if they suffer the fate of all men, then the LORD has not sent me. 
04016030	But if the LORD brings about something unprecedented, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them and all that belongs to them so that they go down alive into Sheol, then you will know that these men have treated the LORD with contempt.” 
04016031	As soon as Moses had finished saying all this, the ground beneath them split open, 
04016032	and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and their households—all Korah’s men and all their possessions. 
04016033	They went down alive into Sheol with all they owned. The earth closed over them, and they vanished from the assembly. 
04016034	At their cries, all the people of Israel who were around them fled, saying, “The earth may swallow us too!” 
04016035	And fire came forth from the LORD and consumed the 250 men who were offering the incense. 
04016036	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
04016037	“Tell Eleazar son of Aaron the priest to remove the censers from the flames and to scatter the coals far away, because the censers are holy. 
04016038	As for the censers of those who sinned at the cost of their own lives, hammer them into sheets to overlay the altar, for these were presented before the LORD, and so have become holy. They will serve as a sign to the Israelites.” 
04016039	So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned up, and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar, 
04016040	just as the LORD commanded him through Moses. This was to be a reminder to the Israelites that no outsider who is not a descendant of Aaron should approach to offer incense before the LORD, lest he become like Korah and his followers. 
04016041	The next day the whole congregation of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron, saying, “You have killed the LORD’s people!” 
04016042	But when the congregation gathered against them, Moses and Aaron turned toward the Tent of Meeting, and suddenly the cloud covered it and the glory of the LORD appeared. 
04016043	Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the Tent of Meeting, 
04016044	and the LORD said to Moses, 
04016045	“Get away from this congregation so that I may consume them in an instant.” And Moses and Aaron fell facedown. 
04016046	Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer, place fire from the altar in it, and add incense. Go quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them, because wrath has come out from the LORD; the plague has begun.” 
04016047	So Aaron took the censer as Moses had ordered and ran into the midst of the assembly. And seeing that the plague had begun among the people, he offered the incense and made atonement for the people. 
04016048	He stood between the living and the dead, and the plague was halted. 
04016049	But those who died from the plague numbered 14,700, in addition to those who had died on account of Korah. 
04016050	Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, since the plague had been halted. 
04017001	And the LORD said to Moses, 
04017002	“Speak to the Israelites and take from them twelve staffs, one from the leader of each tribe. Write each man’s name on his staff, 
04017003	and write Aaron’s name on the staff of Levi, because there must be one staff for the head of each tribe. 
04017004	Place the staffs in the Tent of Meeting in front of the Testimony, where I meet with you. 
04017005	The staff belonging to the man I choose will sprout, and I will rid Myself of the constant grumbling of the Israelites against you.” 
04017006	So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and each of their leaders gave him a staff—one for each of the leaders of their tribes, twelve staffs in all. And Aaron’s staff was among them. 
04017007	Then Moses placed the staffs before the LORD in the Tent of the Testimony. 
04017008	The next day Moses entered the Tent of the Testimony and saw that Aaron’s staff, representing the house of Levi, had sprouted, put forth buds, blossomed, and produced almonds. 
04017009	Then Moses brought out all the staffs from the LORD’s presence to all the Israelites. They saw them, and each man took his own staff. 
04017010	The LORD said to Moses, “Put Aaron’s staff back in front of the Testimony, to be kept as a sign for the rebellious, so that you may put an end to their grumbling against Me, lest they die.” 
04017011	So Moses did as the LORD had commanded him. 
04017012	Then the Israelites declared to Moses, “Look, we are perishing! We are lost; we are all lost! 
04017013	Anyone who comes near the tabernacle of the LORD will die. Are we all going to perish?” 
04018001	So the LORD said to Aaron, “You and your sons and your father’s house must bear the iniquity involving the sanctuary. And you and your sons alone must bear the iniquity involving your priesthood. 
04018002	But bring with you also your brothers from the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, that they may join you and assist you and your sons before the Tent of the Testimony. 
04018003	And they shall attend to your duties and to all the duties of the Tent; but they must not come near to the furnishings of the sanctuary or the altar, or both they and you will die. 
04018004	They are to join you and attend to the duties of the Tent of Meeting, doing all the work at the Tent; but no outsider may come near you. 
04018005	And you shall attend to the duties of the sanctuary and of the altar, so that wrath may not fall on the Israelites again. 
04018006	Behold, I Myself have selected your fellow Levites from the Israelites as a gift to you, dedicated to the LORD to perform the service for the Tent of Meeting. 
04018007	But only you and your sons shall attend to your priesthood for everything concerning the altar and what is inside the veil, and you are to perform that service. I am giving you the work of the priesthood as a gift, but any outsider who comes near the sanctuary must be put to death.” 
04018008	Then the LORD said to Aaron, “Behold, I have put you in charge of My offerings. As for all the sacred offerings of the Israelites, I have given them to you and your sons as a portion and a permanent statute. 
04018009	A portion of the most holy offerings reserved from the fire will be yours. From all the offerings they render to Me as most holy offerings, whether grain offerings or sin offerings or guilt offerings, that part belongs to you and your sons. 
04018010	You are to eat it as a most holy offering, and every male may eat it. You shall regard it as holy. 
04018011	And this is yours as well: the offering of their gifts, along with all the wave offerings of the Israelites. I have given this to you and your sons and daughters as a permanent statute. Every ceremonially clean person in your household may eat it. 
04018012	I give you all the freshest olive oil and all the finest new wine and grain that the Israelites give to the LORD as their firstfruits. 
04018013	The firstfruits of everything in their land that they bring to the LORD will belong to you. Every ceremonially clean person in your household may eat them. 
04018014	Every devoted thing in Israel belongs to you. 
04018015	The firstborn of every womb, whether man or beast, that is offered to the LORD belongs to you. But you must surely redeem every firstborn son and every firstborn male of unclean animals. 
04018016	You are to pay the redemption price for a month-old male according to your valuation: five shekels of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel, which is twenty gerahs. 
04018017	But you must not redeem the firstborn of an ox, a sheep, or a goat; they are holy. You are to splatter their blood on the altar and burn their fat as a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. 
04018018	And their meat belongs to you, just as the breast and right thigh of the wave offering belong to you. 
04018019	All the holy offerings that the Israelites present to the LORD I give to you and to your sons and daughters as a permanent statute. It is a permanent covenant of salt before the LORD for you and your offspring.” 
04018020	Then the LORD said to Aaron, “You will have no inheritance in their land, nor will you have any portion among them. I am your portion and your inheritance among the Israelites. 
04018021	Behold, I have given to the Levites all the tithes in Israel as an inheritance in return for the work they do, the service of the Tent of Meeting. 
04018022	No longer may the Israelites come near to the Tent of Meeting, or they will incur guilt and die. 
04018023	The Levites are to perform the work of the Tent of Meeting, and they must bear their iniquity. This is a permanent statute for the generations to come. The Levites will not receive an inheritance among the Israelites. 
04018024	For I have given to the Levites as their inheritance the tithe that the Israelites present to the LORD as a contribution. That is why I told them that they would not receive an inheritance among the Israelites.” 
04018025	And the LORD instructed Moses, 
04018026	“Speak to the Levites and tell them: ‘When you receive from the Israelites the tithe that I have given you as your inheritance, you must present part of it as an offering to the LORD—a tithe of the tithe. 
04018027	Your offering will be reckoned to you as grain from the threshing floor or juice from the winepress. 
04018028	So you are to present an offering to the LORD from all the tithes you receive from the Israelites, and from these you are to give the LORD’s offering to Aaron the priest. 
04018029	You must present the offering due the LORD from all the best of every gift, the holiest part of it.’ 
04018030	Therefore say to the Levites, ‘When you have presented the best part, it will be reckoned to you as the produce of the threshing floor or winepress. 
04018031	And you and your households may eat the rest of it anywhere; it is the compensation for your work at the Tent of Meeting. 
04018032	Once you have presented the best part of it, you will not incur guilt because of it. But you must not defile the sacred offerings of the Israelites, or else you will die.’” 
04019001	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 
04019002	“This is the statute of the law that the LORD has commanded: Instruct the Israelites to bring you an unblemished red heifer that has no defect and has never been placed under a yoke. 
04019003	Give it to Eleazar the priest, and he will have it brought outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence. 
04019004	Eleazar the priest is to take some of its blood on his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the Tent of Meeting. 
04019005	Then the heifer must be burned in his sight. Its hide, its flesh, and its blood are to be burned, along with its dung. 
04019006	The priest is to take cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet wool and throw them onto the burning heifer. 
04019007	Then the priest must wash his clothes and bathe his body in water; after that he may enter the camp, but he will be ceremonially unclean until evening. 
04019008	The one who burned the heifer must also wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and he too will be ceremonially unclean until evening. 
04019009	Then a man who is ceremonially clean is to gather up the ashes of the heifer and store them in a ceremonially clean place outside the camp. They must be kept by the congregation of Israel for preparing the water of purification; this is for purification from sin. 
04019010	The man who has gathered up the ashes of the heifer must also wash his clothes, and he will be ceremonially unclean until evening. This is a permanent statute for the Israelites and for the foreigner residing among them. 
04019011	Whoever touches any dead body will be unclean for seven days. 
04019012	He must purify himself with the water on the third day and on the seventh day; then he will be clean. But if he does not purify himself on the third and seventh days, he will not be clean. 
04019013	Anyone who touches a human corpse and fails to purify himself defiles the tabernacle of the LORD. That person must be cut off from Israel. He remains unclean, because the water of purification has not been sprinkled on him, and his uncleanness is still on him. 
04019014	This is the law when a person dies in a tent: Everyone who enters the tent and everyone already in the tent will be unclean for seven days, 
04019015	and any open container without a lid fastened on it is unclean. 
04019016	Anyone in the open field who touches someone who has been killed by the sword or has died of natural causes, or anyone who touches a human bone or a grave, will be unclean for seven days. 
04019017	For the purification of the unclean person, take some of the ashes of the burnt sin offering, put them in a jar, and pour fresh water over them. 
04019018	Then a man who is ceremonially clean is to take some hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle the tent, all the furnishings, and the people who were there. He is also to sprinkle the one who touched a bone, a grave, or a person who has died or been slain. 
04019019	The man who is ceremonially clean is to sprinkle the unclean person on the third day and on the seventh day. After he purifies the unclean person on the seventh day, the one being cleansed must wash his clothes and bathe in water, and that evening he will be clean. 
04019020	But if a person who is unclean does not purify himself, he will be cut off from the assembly, because he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD. The water of purification has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean. 
04019021	This is a permanent statute for the people: The one who sprinkles the water of purification must wash his clothes, and whoever touches the water of purification will be unclean until evening. 
04019022	Anything the unclean person touches will become unclean, and anyone who touches it will be unclean until evening.” 
04020001	In the first month, the whole congregation of Israel entered the Wilderness of Zin and stayed in Kadesh. There Miriam died and was buried. 
04020002	Now there was no water for the congregation, so they gathered against Moses and Aaron. 
04020003	The people quarreled with Moses and said, “If only we had perished with our brothers before the LORD! 
04020004	Why have you brought the LORD’s assembly into this wilderness for us and our livestock to die here? 
04020005	Why have you led us up out of Egypt to bring us to this wretched place? It is not a place of grain, figs, vines, or pomegranates—and there is no water to drink!” 
04020006	Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. They fell facedown, and the glory of the LORD appeared to them. 
04020007	And the LORD said to Moses, 
04020008	“Take the staff and assemble the congregation. You and your brother Aaron are to speak to the rock while they watch, and it will pour out its water. You will bring out water from the rock and provide drink for the congregation and their livestock.” 
04020009	So Moses took the staff from the LORD’s presence, just as he had been commanded. 
04020010	Then Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly in front of the rock, and Moses said to them, “Listen now, you rebels, must we bring you water out of this rock?” 
04020011	Then Moses raised his hand and struck the rock twice with his staff, so that a great amount of water gushed out, and the congregation and their livestock were able to drink. 
04020012	But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not trust Me to show My holiness in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring this assembly into the land that I have given them.” 
04020013	These were the waters of Meribah, where the Israelites quarreled with the LORD, and He showed His holiness among them. 
04020014	From Kadesh, Moses sent messengers to tell the king of Edom, “This is what your brother Israel says: You know all the hardship that has befallen us, 
04020015	how our fathers went down to Egypt, where we lived many years. The Egyptians mistreated us and our fathers, 
04020016	and when we cried out to the LORD, He heard our voice, sent an angel, and brought us out of Egypt. Now look, we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your territory. 
04020017	Please let us pass through your land. We will not go through any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will stay on the King’s Highway; we will not turn to the right or to the left until we have passed through your territory.” 
04020018	But Edom answered, “You may not travel through our land, or we will come out and confront you with the sword.” 
04020019	“We will stay on the main road,” the Israelites replied, “and if we or our herds drink your water, we will pay for it. There will be no problem; only let us pass through on foot.” 
04020020	But Edom insisted, “You may not pass through.” And they came out to confront the Israelites with a large army and a strong hand. 
04020021	So Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through their territory, and Israel turned away from them. 
04020022	After they had set out from Kadesh, the whole congregation of Israel came to Mount Hor. 
04020023	And at Mount Hor, near the border of the land of Edom, the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 
04020024	“Aaron will be gathered to his people; he will not enter the land that I have given the Israelites, because both of you rebelled against My command at the waters of Meribah. 
04020025	Take Aaron and his son Eleazar and bring them up Mount Hor. 
04020026	Remove Aaron’s priestly garments and put them on his son Eleazar. Aaron will be gathered to his people and will die there.” 
04020027	So Moses did as the LORD had commanded, and they climbed Mount Hor in the sight of the whole congregation. 
04020028	After Moses had removed Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar, Aaron died there on top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. 
04020029	When the whole congregation saw that Aaron had died, the entire house of Israel mourned for him thirty days. 
04021001	When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming along the road to Atharim, he attacked Israel and captured some prisoners. 
04021002	So Israel made a vow to the LORD: “If You will deliver this people into our hands, we will devote their cities to destruction.” 
04021003	And the LORD heard Israel’s plea and delivered up the Canaanites. Israel devoted them and their cities to destruction; so they named the place Hormah. 
04021004	Then they set out from Mount Hor along the route to the Red Sea, in order to bypass the land of Edom. But the people grew impatient on the journey 
04021005	and spoke against God and against Moses: “Why have you led us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no bread or water, and we detest this wretched food!” 
04021006	So the LORD sent venomous snakes among the people, and many of the Israelites were bitten and died. 
04021007	Then the people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned by speaking against the LORD and against you. Intercede with the LORD so He will take the snakes away from us.” So Moses interceded for the people. 
04021008	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent and mount it on a pole. When anyone who is bitten looks at it, he will live.” 
04021009	So Moses made a bronze snake and mounted it on a pole. If anyone who was bitten looked at the bronze snake, he would live. 
04021010	Then the Israelites set out and camped at Oboth. 
04021011	They journeyed from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim in the wilderness opposite Moab to the east. 
04021012	From there they set out and camped in the Valley of Zered. 
04021013	From there they moved on and camped on the other side of the Arnon, in the wilderness that extends into the Amorite territory. Now the Arnon is the border between the Moabites and the Amorites. 
04021014	Therefore it is stated in the Book of the Wars of the LORD: “Waheb in Suphah and the wadis of the Arnon, 
04021015	even the slopes of the wadis that extend to the site of Ar and lie along the border of Moab.” 
04021016	From there they went on to Beer, the well where the LORD said to Moses, “Gather the people so that I may give them water.” 
04021017	Then Israel sang this song: “Spring up, O well, all of you sing to it! 
04021018	The princes dug the well; the nobles of the people hollowed it out with their scepters and with their staffs.” From the wilderness the Israelites went on to Mattanah, 
04021019	and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth, 
04021020	and from Bamoth to the valley in Moab where the top of Pisgah overlooks the wasteland. 
04021021	Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, 
04021022	“Let us pass through your land. We will not turn aside into any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will stay on the King’s Highway until we have passed through your territory.” 
04021023	But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. Instead, he gathered his whole army and went out to confront Israel in the wilderness. When he came to Jahaz, he fought against Israel. 
04021024	And Israel put him to the sword and took possession of his land, from the Arnon to the Jabbok—but only up to the border of the Ammonites, because it was fortified. 
04021025	Israel captured all the cities of the Amorites and occupied them, including Heshbon and all its villages. 
04021026	Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land as far as the Arnon. 
04021027	That is why the poets say: “Come to Heshbon, let it be rebuilt; let the city of Sihon be restored. 
04021028	For a fire went out from Heshbon, a blaze from the city of Sihon. It consumed Ar of Moab, the rulers of Arnon’s heights. 
04021029	Woe to you, O Moab! You are destroyed, O people of Chemosh! He gave up his sons as refugees, and his daughters into captivity to Sihon king of the Amorites. 
04021030	But we have overthrown them; Heshbon is destroyed as far as Dibon. We demolished them as far as Nophah, which reaches to Medeba.” 
04021031	So Israel lived in the land of the Amorites. 
04021032	After Moses had sent spies to Jazer, Israel captured its villages and drove out the Amorites who were there. 
04021033	Then they turned and went up the road to Bashan, and Og king of Bashan and his whole army came out to meet them in battle at Edrei. 
04021034	But the LORD said to Moses, “Do not fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand, along with all his people and his land. Do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.” 
04021035	So they struck down Og, along with his sons and his whole army, until no remnant was left. And they took possession of his land. 
04022001	Then the Israelites traveled on and camped in the plains of Moab near the Jordan, across from Jericho. 
04022002	Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites, 
04022003	and Moab was terrified of the people because they were numerous. Indeed, Moab dreaded the Israelites. 
04022004	So the Moabites said to the elders of Midian, “This horde will devour everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.” Since Balak son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time, 
04022005	he sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor at Pethor, which is by the Euphrates in the land of his people. “Behold, a people has come out of Egypt,” said Balak. “They cover the face of the land and have settled next to me. 
04022006	So please come now and put a curse on this people, because they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I may be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land; for I know that those you bless are blessed, and those you curse are cursed.” 
04022007	The elders of Moab and Midian departed with the fees for divination in hand. They came to Balaam and relayed to him the words of Balak. 
04022008	“Spend the night here,” Balaam replied, “and I will give you the answer that the LORD speaks to me.” So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam. 
04022009	Then God came to Balaam and asked, “Who are these men with you?” 
04022010	And Balaam said to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message: 
04022011	‘Behold, a people has come out of Egypt, and they cover the face of the land. Now come and put a curse on them for me. Perhaps I may be able to fight against them and drive them away.’” 
04022012	But God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them. You are not to curse this people, for they are blessed.” 
04022013	So Balaam got up the next morning and said to Balak’s princes, “Go back to your homeland, because the LORD has refused to let me go with you.” 
04022014	And the princes of Moab arose, returned to Balak, and said, “Balaam refused to come with us.” 
04022015	Then Balak sent other princes, more numerous and more distinguished than the first messengers. 
04022016	They came to Balaam and said, “This is what Balak son of Zippor says: ‘Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me, 
04022017	for I will honor you richly and do whatever you say. So please come and put a curse on this people for me!’” 
04022018	But Balaam replied to the servants of Balak, “If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything small or great to go beyond the command of the LORD my God. 
04022019	So now, please stay here overnight as the others did, that I may find out what else the LORD has to tell me.” 
04022020	That night God came to Balaam and said, “Since these men have come to summon you, get up and go with them, but you must only do what I tell you.” 
04022021	So in the morning Balaam got up, saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab. 
04022022	Then God’s anger was kindled because Balaam was going along, and the angel of the LORD stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding his donkey, and his two servants were with him. 
04022023	When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, she turned off the path and went into a field. So Balaam beat her to return her to the path. 
04022024	Then the angel of the LORD stood in a narrow passage between two vineyards, with walls on either side. 
04022025	And the donkey saw the angel of the LORD and pressed herself against the wall, crushing Balaam’s foot against it. So he beat her once again. 
04022026	And the angel of the LORD moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn to the right or left. 
04022027	When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she lay down under Balaam, and he became furious and beat her with his staff. 
04022028	Then the LORD opened the donkey’s mouth, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you that you have beaten me these three times?” 
04022029	Balaam answered the donkey, “You have made a fool of me! If I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now!” 
04022030	But the donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not the donkey you have ridden all your life until today? Have I ever treated you this way before?” “No,” he replied. 
04022031	Then the LORD opened Balaam’s eyes, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand. And Balaam bowed low and fell facedown. 
04022032	The angel of the LORD asked him, “Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out to oppose you, because your way is perverse before me. 
04022033	The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If she had not turned away, then by now I would surely have killed you and let her live.” 
04022034	“I have sinned,” Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, “for I did not realize that you were standing in the road to confront me. And now, if this is displeasing in your sight, I will go back home.” 
04022035	But the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but you are to speak only what I tell you.” So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. 
04022036	When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite city on the Arnon border, at the edge of his territory. 
04022037	And he said to Balaam, “Did I not send you an urgent summons? Why did you not come to me? Am I really not able to reward you richly?” 
04022038	“See, I have come to you,” Balaam replied, “but can I say just anything? I must speak only the word that God puts in my mouth.” 
04022039	So Balaam accompanied Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth. 
04022040	Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and he gave portions to Balaam and the princes who were with him. 
04022041	The next morning, Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth-baal. From there he could see the outskirts of the camp of the people. 
04023001	Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build for me seven altars here, and prepare for me seven bulls and seven rams.” 
04023002	So Balak did as Balaam had instructed, and Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
04023003	“Stay here by your burnt offering while I am gone,” Balaam said to Balak. “Perhaps the LORD will meet with me. And whatever He reveals to me, I will tell you.” So Balaam went off to a barren height, 
04023004	and God met with him. “I have set up seven altars,” Balaam said, “and on each altar I have offered a bull and a ram.” 
04023005	Then the LORD put a message in Balaam’s mouth, saying, “Return to Balak and give him this message.” 
04023006	So he returned to Balak, who was standing there beside his burnt offering, with all the princes of Moab. 
04023007	And Balaam lifted up an oracle, saying: “Balak brought me from Aram, the king of Moab from the mountains of the east. ‘Come,’ he said, ‘put a curse on Jacob for me; come and denounce Israel!’ 
04023008	How can I curse those whom God has not cursed? How can I denounce those whom the LORD has not denounced? 
04023009	For I see them from atop the rocky cliffs, and I watch them from the hills. Behold, a people dwelling apart, not reckoning themselves among the nations. 
04023010	Who can count the dust of Jacob or number even a fourth of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous; let my end be like theirs!” 
04023011	Then Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you here to curse my enemies, and behold, you have only blessed them!” 
04023012	But Balaam replied, “Should I not speak exactly what the LORD puts in my mouth?” 
04023013	Then Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place where you can see them. You will only see the outskirts of their camp—not all of them. And from there, curse them for me.” 
04023014	So Balak took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, where he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
04023015	Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your burnt offering while I meet the LORD over there.” 
04023016	And the LORD met with Balaam and put a message in his mouth, saying, “Return to Balak and speak what I tell you.” 
04023017	So he returned to Balak, who was standing there by his burnt offering with the princes of Moab. “What did the LORD say?” Balak asked. 
04023018	Then Balaam lifted up an oracle, saying: “Arise, O Balak, and listen; give ear to me, O son of Zippor. 
04023019	God is not a man, that He should lie, or a son of man, that He should change His mind. Does He speak and not act? Does He promise and not fulfill? 
04023020	I have indeed received a command to bless; He has blessed, and I cannot change it. 
04023021	He considers no disaster for Jacob; He sees no trouble for Israel. The LORD their God is with them, and the shout of the King is among them. 
04023022	God brought them out of Egypt with strength like a wild ox. 
04023023	For there is no spell against Jacob and no divination against Israel. It will now be said of Jacob and Israel, ‘What great things God has done!’ 
04023024	Behold, the people rise like a lioness; they rouse themselves like a lion, not resting until they devour their prey and drink the blood of the slain.” 
04023025	Now Balak said to Balaam, “Then neither curse them at all nor bless them at all!” 
04023026	But Balaam replied, “Did I not tell you that whatever the LORD says, I must do?” 
04023027	“Please come,” said Balak, “I will take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God that you curse them for me from there.” 
04023028	And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which overlooks the wasteland. 
04023029	Then Balaam said, “Build for me seven altars here, and prepare for me seven bulls and seven rams.” 
04023030	So Balak did as Balaam had instructed, and he offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
04024001	And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not seek omens as on previous occasions, but he turned his face toward the wilderness. 
04024002	When Balaam looked up and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the Spirit of God came upon him, 
04024003	and he lifted up an oracle, saying: “This is the prophecy of Balaam son of Beor, the prophecy of a man whose eyes are open, 
04024004	the prophecy of one who hears the words of God, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who bows down with eyes wide open: 
04024005	How lovely are your tents, O Jacob, your dwellings, O Israel! 
04024006	They spread out like palm groves, like gardens beside a stream, like aloes the LORD has planted, like cedars beside the waters. 
04024007	Water will flow from his buckets, and his seed will have abundant water. His king will be greater than Agag, and his kingdom will be exalted. 
04024008	God brought him out of Egypt with strength like a wild ox, to devour hostile nations and crush their bones, to pierce them with arrows. 
04024009	He crouches, he lies down like a lion, like a lioness—who dares to rouse him? Blessed are those who bless you and cursed are those who curse you.” 
04024010	Then Balak’s anger burned against Balaam, and he struck his hands together and said to Balaam, “I summoned you to curse my enemies, but behold, you have persisted in blessing them these three times. 
04024011	Therefore, flee at once to your home! I said I would reward you richly, but instead the LORD has denied your reward.” 
04024012	Balaam answered Balak, “Did I not already tell the messengers you sent me 
04024013	that even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything of my own accord, good or bad, to go beyond the command of the LORD? I must speak whatever the LORD says. 
04024014	Now I am going back to my people, but come, let me warn you what this people will do to your people in the days to come.” 
04024015	Then Balaam lifted up an oracle, saying, “This is the prophecy of Balaam son of Beor, the prophecy of a man whose eyes are open, 
04024016	the prophecy of one who hears the words of God, who has knowledge from the Most High, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who bows down with eyes wide open: 
04024017	I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near. A star will come forth from Jacob, and a scepter will arise from Israel. He will crush the skulls of Moab and strike down all the sons of Sheth. 
04024018	Edom will become a possession, as will Seir, his enemy; but Israel will perform with valor. 
04024019	A ruler will come from Jacob and destroy the survivors of the city.” 
04024020	Then Balaam saw Amalek and lifted up an oracle, saying: “Amalek was first among the nations, but his end is destruction.” 
04024021	Next he saw the Kenites and lifted up an oracle, saying: “Your dwelling place is secure, and your nest is set in a cliff. 
04024022	Yet Kain will be destroyed when Asshur takes you captive.” 
04024023	Once more Balaam lifted up an oracle, saying: “Ah, who can live unless God has ordained it? 
04024024	Ships will come from the coasts of Cyprus; they will subdue Asshur and Eber, but they too will perish forever.” 
04024025	Then Balaam arose and returned to his homeland, and Balak also went on his way. 
04025001	While Israel was staying in Shittim, the men began to indulge in sexual immorality with the daughters of Moab, 
04025002	who also invited them to the sacrifices for their gods. And the people ate and bowed down to these gods. 
04025003	So Israel joined in worshiping Baal of Peor, and the anger of the LORD burned against them. 
04025004	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Take all the leaders of the people and execute them in broad daylight before the LORD, so that His fierce anger may turn away from Israel.” 
04025005	So Moses told the judges of Israel, “Each of you must kill all of his men who have joined in worshiping Baal of Peor.” 
04025006	Just then an Israelite man brought to his family a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses and the whole congregation of Israel while they were weeping at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 
04025007	On seeing this, Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, got up from the assembly, took a spear in his hand, 
04025008	followed the Israelite into his tent, and drove the spear through both of them—through the Israelite and on through the belly of the woman. So the plague against the Israelites was halted, 
04025009	but those who died in the plague numbered 24,000. 
04025010	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
04025011	“Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned My wrath away from the Israelites; for he was zealous for My sake among them, so that I did not consume the Israelites in My zeal. 
04025012	Declare, therefore, that I am granting him My covenant of peace. 
04025013	It will be a covenant of permanent priesthood for him and his descendants, because he was zealous for his God and made atonement for the Israelites.” 
04025014	The name of the Israelite who was slain with the Midianite woman was Zimri son of Salu, the leader of a Simeonite family. 
04025015	And the name of the slain Midianite woman was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur, a tribal chief of a Midianite family. 
04025016	And the LORD said to Moses, 
04025017	“Attack the Midianites and strike them dead. 
04025018	For they assailed you deceitfully when they seduced you in the matter of Peor and their sister Cozbi, the daughter of the Midianite leader, the woman who was killed on the day the plague came because of Peor.” 
04026001	After the plague had ended, the LORD said to Moses and Eleazar son of Aaron the priest, 
04026002	“Take a census of the whole congregation of Israel by the houses of their fathers—all those twenty years of age or older who can serve in the army of Israel.” 
04026003	So on the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho, Moses and Eleazar the priest issued the instruction, 
04026004	“Take a census of the men twenty years of age or older, as the LORD has commanded Moses.” And these were the Israelites who came out of the land of Egypt: 
04026005	Reuben was the firstborn of Israel. These were the descendants of Reuben: The Hanochite clan from Hanoch, the Palluite clan from Pallu, 
04026006	the Hezronite clan from Hezron, and the Carmite clan from Carmi. 
04026007	These were the clans of Reuben, and their registration numbered 43,730. 
04026008	Now the son of Pallu was Eliab, 
04026009	and the sons of Eliab were Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. It was Dathan and Abiram, chosen by the congregation, who rebelled against Moses and Aaron with the followers of Korah who rebelled against the LORD. 
04026010	And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them along with Korah, whose followers died when the fire consumed 250 men. They serve as a warning sign. 
04026011	However, the line of Korah did not die out. 
04026012	These were the descendants of Simeon by their clans: The Nemuelite clan from Nemuel, the Jaminite clan from Jamin, the Jachinite clan from Jachin, 
04026013	the Zerahite clan from Zerah, and the Shaulite clan from Shaul. 
04026014	These were the clans of Simeon, and there were 22,200 men. 
04026015	These were the descendants of Gad by their clans: The Zephonite clan from Zephon, the Haggite clan from Haggi, the Shunite clan from Shuni, 
04026016	the Oznite clan from Ozni, the Erite clan from Eri, 
04026017	the Arodite clan from Arod, and the Arelite clan from Areli. 
04026018	These were the clans of Gad, and their registration numbered 40,500. 
04026019	The sons of Judah were Er and Onan, but they died in the land of Canaan. 
04026020	These were the descendants of Judah by their clans: The Shelanite clan from Shelah, the Perezite clan from Perez, and the Zerahite clan from Zerah. 
04026021	And these were the descendants of Perez: the Hezronite clan from Hezron and the Hamulite clan from Hamul. 
04026022	These were the clans of Judah, and their registration numbered 76,500. 
04026023	These were the descendants of Issachar by their clans: The Tolaite clan from Tola, the Punite clan from Puvah, 
04026024	the Jashubite clan from Jashub, and the Shimronite clan from Shimron. 
04026025	These were the clans of Issachar, and their registration numbered 64,300. 
04026026	These were the descendants of Zebulun by their clans: The Seredite clan from Sered, the Elonite clan from Elon, and the Jahleelite clan from Jahleel. 
04026027	These were the clans of Zebulun, and their registration numbered 60,500. 
04026028	The descendants of Joseph included the clans of Manasseh and Ephraim. 
04026029	These were the descendants of Manasseh: The Machirite clan from Machir, the father of Gilead, and the Gileadite clan from Gilead. 
04026030	These were the descendants of Gilead: the Iezerite clan from Iezer, the Helekite clan from Helek, 
04026031	the Asrielite clan from Asriel, the Shechemite clan from Shechem, 
04026032	the Shemidaite clan from Shemida, and the Hepherite clan from Hepher. 
04026033	Now Zelophehad son of Hepher had no sons but only daughters. The names of his daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 
04026034	These were the clans of Manasseh, and their registration numbered 52,700. 
04026035	These were the descendants of Ephraim by their clans: The Shuthelahite clan from Shuthelah, the Becherite clan from Becher, and the Tahanite clan from Tahan. 
04026036	And the descendants of Shuthelah were the Eranite clan from Eran. 
04026037	These were the clans of Ephraim, and their registration numbered 32,500. These clans were the descendants of Joseph. 
04026038	These were the descendants of Benjamin by their clans: The Belaite clan from Bela, the Ashbelite clan from Ashbel, the Ahiramite clan from Ahiram, 
04026039	the Shuphamite clan from Shupham, and the Huphamite clan from Hupham. 
04026040	And the descendants of Bela from Ard and Naaman were the Ardite clan from Ard and the Naamite clan from Naaman. 
04026041	These were the clans of Benjamin, and their registration numbered 45,600. 
04026042	These were the descendants of Dan by their clans: The Shuhamite clan from Shuham. These were the clans of Dan. 
04026043	All of them were Shuhamite clans, and their registration numbered 64,400. 
04026044	These were the descendants of Asher by their clans: The Imnite clan from Imnah, the Ishvite clan from Ishvi, and the Beriite clan from Beriah. 
04026045	And these were the descendants of Beriah: the Heberite clan from Heber and the Malchielite clan from Malchiel. 
04026046	And the name of Asher’s daughter was Serah. 
04026047	These were the clans of Asher, and their registration numbered 53,400. 
04026048	These were the descendants of Naphtali by their clans: The Jahzeelite clan from Jahzeel, the Gunite clan from Guni, 
04026049	the Jezerite clan from Jezer, and the Shillemite clan from Shillem. 
04026050	These were the clans of Naphtali, and their registration numbered 45,400. 
04026051	These men of Israel numbered 601,730 in all. 
04026052	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
04026053	“The land is to be divided among the tribes as an inheritance, according to the number of names. 
04026054	Increase the inheritance for a large tribe and decrease it for a small one; each tribe is to receive its inheritance according to the number of those registered. 
04026055	Indeed, the land must be divided by lot; they shall receive their inheritance according to the names of the tribes of their fathers. 
04026056	Each inheritance is to be divided by lot among the larger and smaller tribes.” 
04026057	Now these were the Levites numbered by their clans: The Gershonite clan from Gershon, the Kohathite clan from Kohath, and the Merarite clan from Merari. 
04026058	These were the families of the Levites: The Libnite clan, the Hebronite clan, the Mahlite clan, the Mushite clan, and the Korahite clan. Now Kohath was the father of Amram, 
04026059	and Amram’s wife was named Jochebed. She was also a daughter of Levi, born to Levi in Egypt. To Amram she bore Aaron, Moses, and their sister Miriam. 
04026060	Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar were born to Aaron, 
04026061	but Nadab and Abihu died when they offered unauthorized fire before the LORD. 
04026062	The registration of the Levites totaled 23,000, every male a month old or more; they were not numbered among the other Israelites, because no inheritance was given to them among the Israelites. 
04026063	These were the ones numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest when they counted the Israelites on the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho. 
04026064	Among all these, however, there was not one who had been numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest when they counted the Israelites in the Wilderness of Sinai. 
04026065	For the LORD had told them that they would surely die in the wilderness. Not one was left except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun. 
04027001	Now the daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, belonged to the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph. These were the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. They approached 
04027002	the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders, and the whole congregation, and said, 
04027003	“Our father died in the wilderness, but he was not among the followers of Korah who gathered together against the LORD. Instead, he died because of his own sin, and he had no sons. 
04027004	Why should the name of our father disappear from his clan because he had no sons? Give us property among our father’s brothers.” 
04027005	So Moses brought their case before the LORD, 
04027006	and the LORD answered him, 
04027007	“The daughters of Zelophehad speak correctly. You certainly must give them property as an inheritance among their father’s brothers and transfer their father’s inheritance to them. 
04027008	Furthermore, you shall say to the Israelites, ‘If a man dies and leaves no son, you are to transfer his inheritance to his daughter. 
04027009	If he has no daughter, give his inheritance to his brothers. 
04027010	If he has no brothers, give his inheritance to his father’s brothers. 
04027011	And if his father has no brothers, give his inheritance to the next of kin from his clan, that he may take possession of it. This is to be a statutory ordinance for the Israelites, as the LORD has commanded Moses.’” 
04027012	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go up this mountain of the Abarim range and see the land that I have given the Israelites. 
04027013	After you have seen it, you too will be gathered to your people, as your brother Aaron was; 
04027014	for when the congregation contended in the Wilderness of Zin, both of you rebelled against My command to show My holiness in their sight regarding the waters.” Those were the waters of Meribah in Kadesh, in the Wilderness of Zin. 
04027015	So Moses appealed to the LORD, 
04027016	“May the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation 
04027017	who will go out and come in before them, and who will lead them out and bring them in, so that the congregation of the LORD will not be like sheep without a shepherd.” 
04027018	And the LORD replied to Moses, “Take Joshua son of Nun, a man with the Spirit in him, and lay your hands on him. 
04027019	Have him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole congregation, and commission him in their sight. 
04027020	Confer on him some of your authority, so that the whole congregation of Israel will obey him. 
04027021	He shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who will seek counsel for him before the LORD by the judgment of the Urim. At his command, he and all the Israelites with him—the entire congregation—will go out and come in.” 
04027022	Moses did as the LORD had commanded him. He took Joshua, had him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole congregation, 
04027023	and laid his hands on him and commissioned him, as the LORD had instructed through Moses. 
04028001	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
04028002	“Command the Israelites and say to them: See that you present to Me at its appointed time the food for My food offerings, as a pleasing aroma to Me. 
04028003	And tell them that this is the food offering you are to present to the LORD as a regular burnt offering each day: two unblemished year-old male lambs. 
04028004	Offer one lamb in the morning and the other at twilight, 
04028005	along with a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with a quarter hin of oil from pressed olives. 
04028006	This is a regular burnt offering established at Mount Sinai as a pleasing aroma, a food offering to the LORD. 
04028007	The drink offering accompanying each lamb shall be a quarter hin. Pour out the offering of fermented drink to the LORD in the sanctuary area. 
04028008	And offer the second lamb at twilight, with the same grain offering and drink offering as in the morning. It is a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. 
04028009	On the Sabbath day, present two unblemished year-old male lambs, accompanied by a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, as well as a drink offering. 
04028010	This is the burnt offering for every Sabbath, in addition to the regular burnt offering and its drink offering. 
04028011	At the beginning of every month, you are to present to the LORD a burnt offering of two young bulls, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old, all unblemished, 
04028012	along with three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering with each bull, two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering with the ram, 
04028013	and a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering with each lamb. This is a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, a food offering to the LORD. 
04028014	Their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine with each bull, a third of a hin with the ram, and a quarter hin with each lamb. This is the monthly burnt offering to be made at each new moon throughout the year. 
04028015	In addition to the regular burnt offering with its drink offering, one male goat is to be presented to the LORD as a sin offering. 
04028016	The fourteenth day of the first month is the LORD’s Passover. 
04028017	On the fifteenth day of this month, there shall be a feast; for seven days unleavened bread is to be eaten. 
04028018	On the first day there is to be a sacred assembly; you must not do any regular work. 
04028019	Present to the LORD a food offering, a burnt offering of two young bulls, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old, all unblemished. 
04028020	The grain offering shall consist of fine flour mixed with oil; offer three-tenths of an ephah with each bull, two-tenths of an ephah with the ram, 
04028021	and a tenth of an ephah with each of the seven lambs. 
04028022	Include one male goat as a sin offering to make atonement for you. 
04028023	You are to present these in addition to the regular morning burnt offering. 
04028024	Offer the same food each day for seven days as a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. It is to be offered with its drink offering and the regular burnt offering. 
04028025	On the seventh day you shall hold a sacred assembly; you must not do any regular work. 
04028026	On the day of firstfruits, when you present an offering of new grain to the LORD during the Feast of Weeks, you are to hold a sacred assembly; you must not do any regular work. 
04028027	Present a burnt offering of two young bulls, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old as a pleasing aroma to the LORD, 
04028028	together with their grain offerings of fine flour mixed with oil—three-tenths of an ephah with each bull, two-tenths of an ephah with the ram, 
04028029	and a tenth of an ephah with each of the seven lambs. 
04028030	Include one male goat to make atonement for you. 
04028031	Offer them with their drink offerings in addition to the regular burnt offering and its grain offering. The animals must be unblemished. 
04029001	“On the first day of the seventh month, you are to hold a sacred assembly, and you must not do any regular work. This will be a day for you to sound the trumpets. 
04029002	As a pleasing aroma to the LORD, you are to present a burnt offering of one young bull, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old, all unblemished, 
04029003	together with their grain offerings of fine flour mixed with oil—three-tenths of an ephah with the bull, two-tenths of an ephah with the ram, 
04029004	and a tenth of an ephah with each of the seven male lambs. 
04029005	Include one male goat as a sin offering to make atonement for you. 
04029006	These are in addition to the monthly and daily burnt offerings with their prescribed grain offerings and drink offerings. They are a pleasing aroma, a food offering to the LORD. 
04029007	On the tenth day of this seventh month, you are to hold a sacred assembly, and you shall humble yourselves; you must not do any work. 
04029008	Present as a pleasing aroma to the LORD a burnt offering of one young bull, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old, all unblemished, 
04029009	together with their grain offerings of fine flour mixed with oil—three-tenths of an ephah with the bull, two-tenths of an ephah with the ram, 
04029010	and a tenth of an ephah with each of the seven lambs. 
04029011	Include one male goat for a sin offering, in addition to the sin offering of atonement and the regular burnt offering with its grain offering and drink offerings. 
04029012	On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, you are to hold a sacred assembly; you must not do any regular work, and you shall observe a feast to the LORD for seven days. 
04029013	As a pleasing aroma to the LORD, you are to present a food offering, a burnt offering of thirteen young bulls, two rams, and fourteen male lambs a year old, all unblemished, 
04029014	along with the grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil with each of the thirteen bulls, two-tenths of an ephah with each of the two rams, 
04029015	and a tenth of an ephah with each of the fourteen lambs. 
04029016	Include one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering with its grain offering and drink offering. 
04029017	On the second day you are to present twelve young bulls, two rams, and fourteen male lambs a year old, all unblemished, 
04029018	along with the grain and drink offerings for the bulls, rams, and lambs, according to the number prescribed. 
04029019	Include one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering with its grain offering and drink offering. 
04029020	On the third day you are to present eleven bulls, two rams, and fourteen male lambs a year old, all unblemished, 
04029021	along with the grain and drink offerings for the bulls, rams, and lambs, according to the number prescribed. 
04029022	Include one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering with its grain offering and drink offering. 
04029023	On the fourth day you are to present ten bulls, two rams, and fourteen male lambs a year old, all unblemished, 
04029024	along with the grain and drink offerings for the bulls, rams, and lambs, according to the number prescribed. 
04029025	Include one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering with its grain offering and drink offering. 
04029026	On the fifth day you are to present nine bulls, two rams, and fourteen male lambs a year old, all unblemished, 
04029027	along with the grain and drink offerings for the bulls, rams, and lambs, according to the number prescribed. 
04029028	Include one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering with its grain offering and drink offering. 
04029029	On the sixth day you are to present eight bulls, two rams, and fourteen male lambs a year old, all unblemished, 
04029030	along with the grain and drink offerings for the bulls, rams, and lambs, according to the number prescribed. 
04029031	Include one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering with its grain offering and drink offering. 
04029032	On the seventh day you are to present seven bulls, two rams, and fourteen male lambs a year old, all unblemished, 
04029033	along with the grain and drink offerings for the bulls, rams, and lambs, according to the number prescribed. 
04029034	Include one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering with its grain offering and drink offering. 
04029035	On the eighth day you are to hold a solemn assembly; you must not do any regular work. 
04029036	As a pleasing aroma to the LORD, you are to present a food offering, a burnt offering of one bull, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old, all unblemished, 
04029037	along with the grain and drink offerings for the bulls, rams, and lambs, according to the number prescribed. 
04029038	Include one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering with its grain offering and drink offering. 
04029039	You are to present these offerings to the LORD at your appointed times, in addition to your vow and freewill offerings, whether burnt offerings, grain offerings, drink offerings, or peace offerings.” 
04029040	So Moses spoke all this to the Israelites just as the LORD had commanded him. 
04030001	Then Moses said to the heads of the tribes of Israel, “This is what the LORD has commanded: 
04030002	If a man makes a vow to the LORD or swears an oath to obligate himself by a pledge, he must not break his word; he must do everything he has promised. 
04030003	And if a woman in her father’s house during her youth makes a vow to the LORD or obligates herself by a pledge, 
04030004	and her father hears about her vow or pledge but says nothing to her, then all the vows or pledges by which she has bound herself shall stand. 
04030005	But if her father prohibits her on the day he hears about it, then none of the vows or pledges by which she has bound herself shall stand. The LORD will absolve her because her father has prohibited her. 
04030006	If a woman marries while under a vow or rash promise by which she has bound herself, 
04030007	and her husband hears of it but says nothing to her on that day, then the vows or pledges by which she has bound herself shall stand. 
04030008	But if her husband prohibits her when he hears of it, he nullifies the vow that binds her or the rash promise she has made, and the LORD will absolve her. 
04030009	Every vow a widow or divorced woman pledges to fulfill is binding on her. 
04030010	If a woman in her husband’s house has made a vow or put herself under an obligation with an oath, 
04030011	and her husband hears of it but says nothing to her and does not prohibit her, then all the vows or pledges by which she has bound herself shall stand. 
04030012	But if her husband nullifies them on the day he hears of them, then nothing that came from her lips, whether her vows or pledges, shall stand. Her husband has nullified them, and the LORD will absolve her. 
04030013	Her husband may confirm or nullify any vow or any sworn pledge to deny herself. 
04030014	But if her husband says nothing to her from day to day, then he confirms all the vows and pledges that bind her. He has confirmed them, because he said nothing to her on the day he heard about them. 
04030015	But if he nullifies them after he hears of them, then he will bear her iniquity.” 
04030016	These are the statutes that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the relationship between a man and his wife, and between a father and a young daughter still in his home. 
04031001	And the LORD said to Moses, 
04031002	“Take vengeance on the Midianites for the Israelites. After that, you will be gathered to your people.” 
04031003	So Moses told the people, “Arm some of your men for war, that they may go against the Midianites and execute the LORD’s vengeance on them. 
04031004	Send into battle a thousand men from each tribe of Israel.” 
04031005	So a thousand men were recruited from each tribe of Israel—twelve thousand armed for war. 
04031006	And Moses sent the thousand from each tribe into battle, along with Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, who took with him the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for signaling. 
04031007	Then they waged war against Midian, as the LORD had commanded Moses, and they killed every male. 
04031008	Among the slain were Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba—the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword. 
04031009	The Israelites captured the Midianite women and their children, and they plundered all their herds, flocks, and goods. 
04031010	Then they burned all the cities where the Midianites had lived, as well as all their encampments, 
04031011	and carried away all the plunder and spoils, both people and animals. 
04031012	They brought the captives, spoils, and plunder to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of Israel at the camp on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan across from Jericho. 
04031013	And Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the congregation went to meet them outside the camp. 
04031014	But Moses was angry with the officers of the army—the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds—who were returning from the battle. 
04031015	“Have you spared all the women?” he asked them. 
04031016	“Look, these women caused the sons of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to turn unfaithfully against the LORD at Peor, so that the plague struck the congregation of the LORD. 
04031017	So now, kill all the boys, as well as every woman who has had relations with a man, 
04031018	but spare for yourselves every girl who has never had relations with a man. 
04031019	All of you who have killed a person or touched the dead are to remain outside the camp for seven days. On the third day and the seventh day you are to purify both yourselves and your captives. 
04031020	And purify every garment and leather good, everything made of goat’s hair, and every article of wood.” 
04031021	Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle, “This is the statute of the law which the LORD has commanded Moses: 
04031022	Only the gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, and lead— 
04031023	everything that can withstand the fire—must be put through the fire, and it will be clean. But it must still be purified with the water of purification. And everything that cannot withstand the fire must pass through the water. 
04031024	On the seventh day you are to wash your clothes, and you will be clean. After that you may enter the camp.” 
04031025	The LORD said to Moses, 
04031026	“You and Eleazar the priest and the family heads of the congregation are to take a count of what was captured, both of man and beast. 
04031027	Then divide the captives between the troops who went out to battle and the rest of the congregation. 
04031028	Set aside a tribute for the LORD from what belongs to the soldiers who went into battle: one out of every five hundred, whether persons, cattle, donkeys, or sheep. 
04031029	Take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest as an offering to the LORD. 
04031030	From the Israelites’ half, take one out of every fifty, whether persons, cattle, donkeys, sheep, or other animals, and give them to the Levites who keep charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.” 
04031031	So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD had commanded Moses, 
04031032	and this plunder remained from the spoils the soldiers had taken: 675,000 sheep, 
04031033	72,000 cattle, 
04031034	61,000 donkeys, 
04031035	and 32,000 women who had not slept with a man. 
04031036	This was the half portion for those who had gone to war: 337,500 sheep, 
04031037	including a tribute to the LORD of 675, 
04031038	36,000 cattle, including a tribute to the LORD of 72, 
04031039	30,500 donkeys, including a tribute to the LORD of 61, 
04031040	and 16,000 people, including a tribute to the LORD of 32. 
04031041	Moses gave the tribute to Eleazar the priest as an offering for the LORD, as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
04031042	From the Israelites’ half, which Moses had set apart from the men who had gone to war, 
04031043	this half belonged to the congregation: 337,500 sheep, 
04031044	36,000 cattle, 
04031045	30,500 donkeys, 
04031046	and 16,000 people. 
04031047	From the Israelites’ half, Moses took one out of every fifty persons and animals and gave them to the Levites who kept charge of the tabernacle of the LORD, as the LORD had commanded him. 
04031048	Then the officers who were over the units of the army—the commanders of thousands and of hundreds—approached Moses 
04031049	and said, “Your servants have counted the soldiers under our command, and not one of us is missing. 
04031050	So we have brought to the LORD an offering of the gold articles each man acquired—armlets, bracelets, rings, earrings, and necklaces—to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD.” 
04031051	So Moses and Eleazar the priest received from them all the articles made out of gold. 
04031052	All the gold that the commanders of thousands and of hundreds presented as an offering to the LORD weighed 16,750 shekels. 
04031053	Each of the soldiers had taken plunder for himself. 
04031054	And Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds and brought it into the Tent of Meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before the LORD. 
04032001	Now the Reubenites and Gadites, who had very large herds and flocks, surveyed the lands of Jazer and Gilead, and they saw that the region was suitable for livestock. 
04032002	So the Gadites and Reubenites came to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the congregation, and said, 
04032003	“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon, 
04032004	which the LORD conquered before the congregation of Israel, are suitable for livestock—and your servants have livestock.” 
04032005	“If we have found favor in your sight,” they said, “let this land be given to your servants as a possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan.” 
04032006	But Moses asked the Gadites and Reubenites, “Shall your brothers go to war while you sit here? 
04032007	Why are you discouraging the Israelites from crossing into the land that the LORD has given them? 
04032008	This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to inspect the land. 
04032009	For when your fathers went up to the Valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the Israelites from entering the land that the LORD had given them. 
04032010	So the anger of the LORD was kindled that day, and He swore an oath, saying, 
04032011	‘Because they did not follow Me wholeheartedly, not one of the men twenty years of age or older who came out of Egypt will see the land that I swore to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob— 
04032012	not one except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun—because they did follow the LORD wholeheartedly.’ 
04032013	The anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until the whole generation who had done evil in His sight was gone. 
04032014	Now behold, you, a brood of sinners, have risen up in place of your fathers to further stoke the burning anger of the LORD against Israel. 
04032015	For if you turn away from following Him, He will once again leave this people in the wilderness, and you will be the cause of their destruction.” 
04032016	Then the Gadites and Reubenites approached Moses and said, “We want to build sheepfolds here for our livestock and cities for our little ones. 
04032017	But we will arm ourselves and be ready to go ahead of the Israelites until we have brought them into their place. Meanwhile, our little ones will remain in the fortified cities for protection from the inhabitants of the land. 
04032018	We will not return to our homes until every Israelite has taken possession of his inheritance. 
04032019	Yet we will not have an inheritance with them across the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has come to us on the east side of the Jordan.” 
04032020	Moses replied, “If you will do this—if you will arm yourselves before the LORD for battle, 
04032021	and if every one of your armed men crosses the Jordan before the LORD, until He has driven His enemies out before Him, 
04032022	then when the land is subdued before the LORD, you may return and be free of obligation to the LORD and to Israel. And this land will belong to you as a possession before the LORD. 
04032023	But if you do not do this, you will certainly sin against the LORD—and be assured that your sin will find you out. 
04032024	Build cities for your little ones and folds for your flocks, but do what you have promised.” 
04032025	The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses, “Your servants will do just as our lord commands. 
04032026	Our children, our wives, our livestock, and all our animals will remain here in the cities of Gilead. 
04032027	But your servants are equipped for war, and every man will cross over to the battle before the LORD, just as our lord says.” 
04032028	So Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua son of Nun, and to the family leaders of the tribes of Israel. 
04032029	And Moses said to them, “If the Gadites and Reubenites cross the Jordan with you, with every man armed for battle before the LORD, and the land is subdued before you, then you are to give them the land of Gilead as a possession. 
04032030	But if they do not arm themselves and go across with you, then they must accept their possession among you in the land of Canaan.” 
04032031	The Gadites and Reubenites replied, “As the LORD has spoken to your servants, so we will do. 
04032032	We will cross over into the land of Canaan armed before the LORD, that we may have our inheritance on this side of the Jordan.” 
04032033	So Moses gave to the Gadites, to the Reubenites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan—the land including its cities and the territory surrounding them. 
04032034	And the Gadites built up Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, 
04032035	Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, 
04032036	Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran as fortified cities, and they built folds for their flocks. 
04032037	The Reubenites built up Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, 
04032038	as well as Nebo and Baal-meon (whose names were changed), and Sibmah. And they renamed the cities they rebuilt. 
04032039	The descendants of Machir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it, and drove out the Amorites who were there. 
04032040	So Moses gave Gilead to the clan of Machir son of Manasseh, and they settled there. 
04032041	Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, went and captured their villages and called them Havvoth-jair. 
04032042	And Nobah went and captured Kenath and its villages and called it Nobah, after his own name. 
04033001	These are the journeys of the Israelites when they came out of the land of Egypt by their divisions under the leadership of Moses and Aaron. 
04033002	At the LORD’s command, Moses recorded the stages of their journey. These are the stages listed by their starting points: 
04033003	On the fifteenth day of the first month, on the day after the Passover, the Israelites set out from Rameses. They marched out defiantly in full view of all the Egyptians, 
04033004	who were burying all their firstborn, whom the LORD had struck down among them; for the LORD had executed judgment against their gods. 
04033005	The Israelites set out from Rameses and camped at Succoth. 
04033006	They set out from Succoth and camped at Etham, on the edge of the wilderness. 
04033007	They set out from Etham and turned back to Pi-hahiroth, opposite Baal-zephon, and they camped near Migdol. 
04033008	They set out from Pi-hahiroth and crossed through the sea, into the wilderness, and they journeyed three days into the Wilderness of Etham and camped at Marah. 
04033009	They set out from Marah and came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, and they camped there. 
04033010	They set out from Elim and camped by the Red Sea. 
04033011	They set out from the Red Sea and camped in the Desert of Sin. 
04033012	They set out from the Desert of Sin and camped at Dophkah. 
04033013	They set out from Dophkah and camped at Alush. 
04033014	They set out from Alush and camped at Rephidim, where there was no water for the people to drink. 
04033015	They set out from Rephidim and camped in the Wilderness of Sinai. 
04033016	They set out from the Wilderness of Sinai and camped at Kibroth-hattaavah. 
04033017	They set out from Kibroth-hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth. 
04033018	They set out from Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah. 
04033019	They set out from Rithmah and camped at Rimmon-perez. 
04033020	They set out from Rimmon-perez and camped at Libnah. 
04033021	They set out from Libnah and camped at Rissah. 
04033022	They set out from Rissah and camped at Kehelathah. 
04033023	They set out from Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shepher. 
04033024	They set out from Mount Shepher and camped at Haradah. 
04033025	They set out from Haradah and camped at Makheloth. 
04033026	They set out from Makheloth and camped at Tahath. 
04033027	They set out from Tahath and camped at Terah. 
04033028	They set out from Terah and camped at Mithkah. 
04033029	They set out from Mithkah and camped at Hashmonah. 
04033030	They set out from Hashmonah and camped at Moseroth. 
04033031	They set out from Moseroth and camped at Bene-jaakan. 
04033032	They set out from Bene-jaakan and camped at Hor-haggidgad. 
04033033	They set out from Hor-haggidgad and camped at Jotbathah. 
04033034	They set out from Jotbathah and camped at Abronah. 
04033035	They set out from Abronah and camped at Ezion-geber. 
04033036	They set out from Ezion-geber and camped at Kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin. 
04033037	They set out from Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, on the outskirts of the land of Edom. 
04033038	At the LORD’s command, Aaron the priest climbed Mount Hor and died there on the first day of the fifth month, in the fortieth year after the Israelites had come out of the land of Egypt. 
04033039	Aaron was 123 years old when he died on Mount Hor. 
04033040	Now the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev in the land of Canaan, heard that the Israelites were coming. 
04033041	And the Israelites set out from Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah. 
04033042	They set out from Zalmonah and camped at Punon. 
04033043	They set out from Punon and camped at Oboth. 
04033044	They set out from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim on the border of Moab. 
04033045	They set out from Iyim and camped at Dibon-gad. 
04033046	They set out from Dibon-gad and camped at Almon-diblathaim. 
04033047	They set out from Almon-diblathaim and camped in the mountains of Abarim facing Nebo. 
04033048	They set out from the mountains of Abarim and camped on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho. 
04033049	And there on the plains of Moab they camped by the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth to Abel-shittim. 
04033050	On the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, the LORD said to Moses, 
04033051	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan, 
04033052	you must drive out before you all the inhabitants of the land, destroy all their carved images and cast idols, and demolish all their high places. 
04033053	You are to take possession of the land and settle in it, for I have given you the land to possess. 
04033054	And you are to divide the land by lot according to your clans. Give a larger inheritance to a larger clan and a smaller inheritance to a smaller one. Whatever falls to each one by lot will be his. You will receive an inheritance according to the tribes of your fathers. 
04033055	But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land before you, those you allow to remain will become barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides; they will harass you in the land where you settle. 
04033056	And then I will do to you what I had planned to do to them.” 
04034001	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
04034002	“Command the Israelites and say to them: When you enter the land of Canaan, it will be allotted to you as an inheritance with these boundaries: 
04034003	Your southern border will extend from the Wilderness of Zin along the border of Edom. On the east, your southern border will run from the end of the Salt Sea, 
04034004	cross south of the Ascent of Akrabbim, continue to Zin, and go south of Kadesh-barnea. Then it will go on to Hazar-addar and proceed to Azmon, 
04034005	where it will turn from Azmon, join the Brook of Egypt, and end at the Sea. 
04034006	Your western border will be the coastline of the Great Sea; this will be your boundary on the west. 
04034007	Your northern border will run from the Great Sea directly to Mount Hor, 
04034008	and from Mount Hor to Lebo-hamath, then extend to Zedad, 
04034009	continue to Ziphron, and end at Hazar-enan. This will be your boundary on the north. 
04034010	And your eastern border will run straight from Hazar-enan to Shepham, 
04034011	then go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain and continue along the slopes east of the Sea of Chinnereth. 
04034012	Then the border will go down along the Jordan and end at the Salt Sea. This will be your land, defined by its borders on all sides.” 
04034013	So Moses commanded the Israelites, “Apportion this land by lot as an inheritance. The LORD has commanded that it be given to the nine and a half tribes. 
04034014	For the tribes of the Reubenites and Gadites, along with the half-tribe of Manasseh, have already received their inheritance. 
04034015	These two and a half tribes have received their inheritance across the Jordan from Jericho, toward the sunrise.” 
04034016	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
04034017	“These are the names of the men who are to assign the land as an inheritance for you: Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun. 
04034018	Appoint one leader from each tribe to distribute the land. 
04034019	These are their names: Caleb son of Jephunneh from the tribe of Judah; 
04034020	Shemuel son of Ammihud from the tribe of Simeon; 
04034021	Elidad son of Chislon from the tribe of Benjamin; 
04034022	Bukki son of Jogli, a leader from the tribe of Dan; 
04034023	Hanniel son of Ephod, a leader from the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph; 
04034024	Kemuel son of Shiphtan, a leader from the tribe of Ephraim; 
04034025	Eli-zaphan son of Parnach, a leader from the tribe of Zebulun; 
04034026	Paltiel son of Azzan, a leader from the tribe of Issachar; 
04034027	Ahihud son of Shelomi, a leader from the tribe of Asher; 
04034028	and Pedahel son of Ammihud, a leader from the tribe of Naphtali.” 
04034029	These are the ones whom the LORD commanded to apportion the inheritance to the Israelites in the land of Canaan. 
04035001	Again the LORD spoke to Moses on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho: 
04035002	“Command the Israelites to give, from the inheritance they will possess, cities for the Levites to live in and pasturelands around the cities. 
04035003	The cities will be for them to live in, and the pasturelands will be for their herds, their flocks, and all their other livestock. 
04035004	The pasturelands around the cities you are to give the Levites will extend a thousand cubits from the wall on every side. 
04035005	You are also to measure two thousand cubits outside the city on the east, two thousand on the south, two thousand on the west, and two thousand on the north, with the city in the center. These areas will serve as larger pasturelands for the cities. 
04035006	Six of the cities you give the Levites are to be appointed as cities of refuge, to which a manslayer may flee. In addition to these, give the Levites forty-two other cities. 
04035007	The total number of cities you give the Levites will be forty-eight, with their corresponding pasturelands. 
04035008	The cities that you apportion from the territory of the Israelites should be given to the Levites in proportion to the inheritance of each tribe: more from a larger tribe and less from a smaller one.” 
04035009	Then the LORD said to Moses, 
04035010	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan, 
04035011	designate cities to serve as your cities of refuge, so that a person who kills someone unintentionally may flee there. 
04035012	You are to have these cities as a refuge from the avenger, so that the manslayer will not die until he stands trial before the assembly. 
04035013	The cities you select will be your six cities of refuge. 
04035014	Select three cities across the Jordan and three in the land of Canaan as cities of refuge. 
04035015	These six cities will serve as a refuge for the Israelites and for the foreigner or stranger among them, so that anyone who kills a person unintentionally may flee there. 
04035016	If, however, anyone strikes a person with an iron object and kills him, he is a murderer; the murderer must surely be put to death. 
04035017	Or if anyone has in his hand a stone of deadly size, and he strikes and kills another, he is a murderer; the murderer must surely be put to death. 
04035018	If anyone has in his hand a deadly object of wood, and he strikes and kills another, he is a murderer; the murderer must surely be put to death. 
04035019	The avenger of blood is to put the murderer to death; when he finds him, he is to kill him. 
04035020	Likewise, if anyone maliciously pushes another or intentionally throws an object at him and kills him, 
04035021	or if in hostility he strikes him with his hand and he dies, the one who struck him must surely be put to death; he is a murderer. When the avenger of blood finds the murderer, he is to kill him. 
04035022	But if anyone pushes a person suddenly, without hostility, or throws an object at him unintentionally, 
04035023	or without looking drops a heavy stone that kills him, but he was not an enemy and did not intend to harm him, 
04035024	then the congregation must judge between the slayer and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances. 
04035025	The assembly is to protect the manslayer from the hand of the avenger of blood. Then the assembly will return him to the city of refuge to which he fled, and he must live there until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil. 
04035026	But if the manslayer ever goes outside the limits of the city of refuge to which he fled 
04035027	and the avenger of blood finds him outside of his city of refuge and kills him, then the avenger will not be guilty of bloodshed, 
04035028	because the manslayer must remain in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. Only after the death of the high priest may he return to the land he owns. 
04035029	This will be a statutory ordinance for you for the generations to come, wherever you live. 
04035030	If anyone kills a person, the murderer is to be put to death on the testimony of the witnesses. But no one is to be put to death based on the testimony of a lone witness. 
04035031	You are not to accept a ransom for the life of a murderer who deserves to die; he must surely be put to death. 
04035032	Nor should you accept a ransom for the person who flees to a city of refuge and allow him to return and live on his own land before the death of the high priest. 
04035033	Do not pollute the land where you live, for bloodshed pollutes the land, and no atonement can be made for the land on which the blood is shed, except by the blood of the one who shed it. 
04035034	Do not defile the land where you live and where I dwell. For I, the LORD, dwell among the Israelites.” 
04036001	Now the family heads of the clan of Gilead son of Machir son of Manasseh, one of the clans of Joseph, approached Moses and the leaders who were the heads of the Israelite families and addressed them, 
04036002	saying, “When the LORD commanded my lord to give the land as an inheritance to the Israelites by lot, He also commanded him to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters. 
04036003	But if they marry any of the men from the other tribes of Israel, their inheritance will be withdrawn from the portion of our fathers and added to the tribe into which they marry. So our allotted inheritance would be taken away. 
04036004	And when the Jubilee for the Israelites comes, their inheritance will be added to the tribe into which they marry and taken away from the tribe of our fathers.” 
04036005	So at the word of the LORD, Moses commanded the Israelites: “The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks correctly. 
04036006	This is what the LORD has commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad: They may marry anyone they please, provided they marry within a clan of the tribe of their father. 
04036007	No inheritance in Israel may be transferred from tribe to tribe, because each of the Israelites is to retain the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. 
04036008	Every daughter who possesses an inheritance from any Israelite tribe must marry within a clan of the tribe of her father, so that every Israelite will possess the inheritance of his fathers. 
04036009	No inheritance may be transferred from one tribe to another, for each tribe of Israel must retain its inheritance.” 
04036010	So the daughters of Zelophehad did as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
04036011	Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to cousins on their father’s side. 
04036012	They married within the clans of the descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained within the tribe of their father’s clan. 
04036013	These are the commandments and ordinances that the LORD gave the Israelites through Moses on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho. 
05001001	These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel in the wilderness east of the Jordan—in the Arabah opposite Suph—between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab. 
05001002	It is an eleven-day journey from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea by way of Mount Seir. 
05001003	In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses proclaimed to the Israelites all that the LORD had commanded him concerning them. 
05001004	This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and then at Edrei had defeated Og king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth. 
05001005	On the east side of the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this law, saying: 
05001006	The LORD our God said to us at Horeb: “You have stayed at this mountain long enough. 
05001007	Resume your journey and go to the hill country of the Amorites; go to all the neighboring peoples in the Arabah, in the hill country, in the foothills, in the Negev, and along the seacoast to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great River Euphrates. 
05001008	See, I have placed the land before you. Enter and possess the land that the LORD swore He would give to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to their descendants after them.” 
05001009	At that time I said to you, “I cannot carry the burden for you alone. 
05001010	The LORD your God has multiplied you, so that today you are as numerous as the stars in the sky. 
05001011	May the LORD, the God of your fathers, increase you a thousand times over and bless you as He has promised. 
05001012	But how can I bear your troubles, burdens, and disputes all by myself? 
05001013	Choose for yourselves wise, understanding, and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will appoint them as your leaders.” 
05001014	And you answered me and said, “What you propose to do is good.” 
05001015	So I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and respected men, and appointed them as leaders over you—as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens, and as officers for your tribes. 
05001016	At that time I charged your judges: “Hear the disputes between your brothers, and judge fairly between a man and his brother or a foreign resident. 
05001017	Show no partiality in judging; hear both small and great alike. Do not be intimidated by anyone, for judgment belongs to God. And bring to me any case too difficult for you, and I will hear it.” 
05001018	And at that time I commanded you all the things you were to do. 
05001019	And just as the LORD our God had commanded us, we set out from Horeb and went toward the hill country of the Amorites, through all the vast and terrifying wilderness you have seen. When we reached Kadesh-barnea, 
05001020	I said: “You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God is giving us. 
05001021	See, the LORD your God has placed the land before you. Go up and take possession of it as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has told you. Do not be afraid or discouraged.” 
05001022	Then all of you approached me and said, “Let us send men ahead of us to search out the land and bring us word of what route to follow and which cities to enter.” 
05001023	The plan seemed good to me, so I selected twelve men from among you, one from each tribe. 
05001024	They left and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshcol and spied out the land. 
05001025	They took some of the fruit of the land in their hands, carried it down to us, and brought us word: “It is a good land that the LORD our God is giving us.” 
05001026	But you were unwilling to go up; you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God. 
05001027	You grumbled in your tents and said, “Because the LORD hates us, He has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to be annihilated. 
05001028	Where can we go? Our brothers have made our hearts melt, saying: ‘The people are larger and taller than we are; the cities are large, with walls up to the heavens. We even saw the descendants of the Anakim there.’” 
05001029	So I said to you: “Do not be terrified or afraid of them! 
05001030	The LORD your God, who goes before you, will fight for you, just as you saw Him do for you in Egypt 
05001031	and in the wilderness, where the LORD your God carried you, as a man carries his son, all the way by which you traveled until you reached this place.” 
05001032	But in spite of all this, you did not trust the LORD your God, 
05001033	who went before you on the journey, in the fire by night and in the cloud by day, to seek out a place for you to camp and to show you the road to travel. 
05001034	When the LORD heard your words, He grew angry and swore an oath, saying, 
05001035	“Not one of the men of this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give your fathers, 
05001036	except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land on which he has set foot, because he followed the LORD wholeheartedly.” 
05001037	The LORD was also angry with me on your account, and He said, “Not even you shall enter the land. 
05001038	Joshua son of Nun, who stands before you, will enter it. Encourage him, for he will enable Israel to inherit the land. 
05001039	And the little ones you said would become captives—your children who on that day did not know good from evil—will enter the land that I will give them, and they will possess it. 
05001040	But you are to turn back and head for the wilderness along the route to the Red Sea.” 
05001041	“We have sinned against the LORD,” you replied. “We will go up and fight, as the LORD our God has commanded us.” Then each of you put on his weapons of war, thinking it easy to go up into the hill country. 
05001042	But the LORD said to me, “Tell them not to go up and fight, for I am not with you to keep you from defeat by your enemies.” 
05001043	So I spoke to you, but you would not listen. You rebelled against the command of the LORD and presumptuously went up into the hill country. 
05001044	Then the Amorites who lived in the hills came out against you and chased you like a swarm of bees. They routed you from Seir all the way to Hormah. 
05001045	And you returned and wept before the LORD, but He would not listen to your voice or give ear to you. 
05001046	For this reason you stayed in Kadesh for a long time—a very long time. 
05002001	Then we turned back and headed for the wilderness by way of the Red Sea, as the LORD had instructed me, and for many days we wandered around Mount Seir. 
05002002	At this time the LORD said to me, 
05002003	“You have been wandering around this hill country long enough; turn to the north 
05002004	and command the people: ‘You will pass through the territory of your brothers, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, so you must be very careful. 
05002005	Do not provoke them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even a footprint, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as his possession. 
05002006	You are to pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink.’” 
05002007	Indeed, the LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey through this vast wilderness. The LORD your God has been with you these forty years, and you have lacked nothing. 
05002008	So we passed by our brothers, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We turned away from the Arabah road, which comes up from Elath and Ezion-geber, and traveled along the road of the Wilderness of Moab. 
05002009	Then the LORD said to me, “Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land, because I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as their possession.” 
05002010	(The Emites used to live there, a people great and many, as tall as the Anakites. 
05002011	Like the Anakites, they were also regarded as Rephaim, though the Moabites called them Emites. 
05002012	The Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out. They destroyed the Horites from before them and settled in their place, just as Israel did in the land that the LORD gave them as their possession.) 
05002013	“Now arise and cross over the Brook of Zered.” So we crossed over the Brook of Zered. 
05002014	The time we spent traveling from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed over the Brook of Zered was thirty-eight years, until that entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them. 
05002015	Indeed, the LORD’s hand was against them, to eliminate them from the camp, until they had all perished. 
05002016	Now when all the fighting men among the people had died, 
05002017	the LORD said to me, 
05002018	“Today you are going to cross the border of Moab at Ar. 
05002019	But when you get close to the Ammonites, do not harass them or provoke them, for I will not give you any of the land of the Ammonites. I have given it to the descendants of Lot as their possession.” 
05002020	(That too was regarded as the land of the Rephaim, who used to live there, though the Ammonites called them Zamzummites. 
05002021	They were a people great and many, as tall as the Anakites. But the LORD destroyed them from before the Ammonites, who drove them out and settled in their place, 
05002022	just as He had done for the descendants of Esau who lived in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them. They drove them out and have lived in their place to this day. 
05002023	And the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, were destroyed by the Caphtorites, who came out of Caphtor and settled in their place.) 
05002024	“Arise, set out, and cross the Arnon Valley. See, I have delivered into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to take possession of it and engage him in battle. 
05002025	This very day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon all the nations under heaven. They will hear the reports of you and tremble in anguish because of you.” 
05002026	So from the Wilderness of Kedemoth I sent messengers with an offer of peace to Sihon king of Heshbon, saying, 
05002027	“Let us pass through your land; we will stay on the main road. We will not turn to the right or to the left. 
05002028	You can sell us food to eat and water to drink in exchange for silver. Only let us pass through on foot, 
05002029	just as the descendants of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for us, until we cross the Jordan into the land that the LORD our God is giving us.” 
05002030	But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass through, for the LORD your God had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate, that He might deliver him into your hand, as is the case this day. 
05002031	Then the LORD said to me, “See, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his land over to you. Now begin to conquer and possess his land.” 
05002032	So Sihon and his whole army came out for battle against us at Jahaz. 
05002033	And the LORD our God delivered him over to us, and we defeated him and his sons and his whole army. 
05002034	At that time we captured all his cities and devoted to destruction the people of every city, including women and children. We left no survivors. 
05002035	We carried off for ourselves only the livestock and the plunder from the cities we captured. 
05002036	From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley, along with the city in the valley, even as far as Gilead, not one city had walls too high for us. The LORD our God gave us all of them. 
05002037	But you did not go near the land of the Ammonites, or the land along the banks of the Jabbok River, or the cities of the hill country, or any place that the LORD our God had forbidden. 
05003001	Then we turned and went up the road to Bashan, and Og king of Bashan and his whole army came out to meet us in battle at Edrei. 
05003002	But the LORD said to me, “Do not fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand, along with all his people and his land. Do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.” 
05003003	So the LORD our God also delivered Og king of Bashan and his whole army into our hands. We struck them down until no survivor was left. 
05003004	At that time we captured all sixty of his cities. There was not a single city we failed to take—the entire region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
05003005	All these cities were fortified with high walls and gates and bars, and there were many more unwalled villages. 
05003006	We devoted them to destruction, as we had done to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children of every city. 
05003007	But all the livestock and plunder of the cities we carried off for ourselves. 
05003008	At that time we took from the two kings of the Amorites the land across the Jordan, from the Arnon Valley as far as Mount Hermon— 
05003009	which the Sidonians call Sirion but the Amorites call Senir— 
05003010	all the cities of the plateau, all of Gilead, and all of Bashan as far as the cities of Salecah and Edrei in the kingdom of Og. 
05003011	(For only Og king of Bashan had remained of the remnant of the Rephaim. His bed of iron, nine cubits long and four cubits wide, is still in Rabbah of the Ammonites.) 
05003012	So at that time we took possession of this land. To the Reubenites and Gadites I gave the land beyond Aroer along the Arnon Valley, and half the hill country of Gilead, along with its cities. 
05003013	To the half-tribe of Manasseh I gave the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og. (The entire region of Argob, the whole territory of Bashan, used to be called the land of the Rephaim.) 
05003014	Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites. He renamed Bashan after himself, Havvoth-jair, by which it is called to this day. 
05003015	To Machir I gave Gilead, 
05003016	and to the Reubenites and Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead to the Arnon Valley (the middle of the valley was the border) and up to the Jabbok River, the border of the Ammonites. 
05003017	The Jordan River in the Arabah bordered it from Chinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea ) with the slopes of Pisgah to the east. 
05003018	At that time I commanded you: “The LORD your God has given you this land to possess. All your men of valor are to cross over, armed for battle, ahead of your brothers, the Israelites. 
05003019	But your wives, your children, and your livestock—I know that you have much livestock—may remain in the cities I have given you, 
05003020	until the LORD gives rest to your brothers as He has to you, and they too have taken possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving them across the Jordan. Then each of you may return to the possession I have given you.” 
05003021	And at that time I commanded Joshua: “Your own eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings. The LORD will do the same to all the kingdoms you are about to enter. 
05003022	Do not be afraid of them, for the LORD your God Himself will fight for you.” 
05003023	At that time I also pleaded with the LORD: 
05003024	“O Lord GOD, You have begun to show Your greatness and power to Your servant. For what god in heaven or on earth can perform such works and mighty acts as Yours? 
05003025	Please let me cross over and see the good land beyond the Jordan—that pleasant hill country as well as Lebanon!” 
05003026	But the LORD was angry with me on account of you, and He would not listen to me. “That is enough,” the LORD said to me. “Do not speak to Me again about this matter. 
05003027	Go to the top of Pisgah and look to the west and north and south and east. See the land with your own eyes, for you will not cross this Jordan. 
05003028	But commission Joshua, encourage him, and strengthen him, for he will cross over ahead of the people and enable them to inherit the land that you will see.” 
05003029	So we stayed in the valley opposite Beth-peor. 
05004001	Hear now, O Israel, the statutes and ordinances I am teaching you to follow, so that you may live and may enter and take possession of the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, is giving you. 
05004002	You must not add to or subtract from what I command you, so that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God that I am giving you. 
05004003	Your eyes have seen what the LORD did at Baal-peor, for the LORD your God destroyed from among you all who followed Baal of Peor. 
05004004	But you who held fast to the LORD your God are alive to this day, every one of you. 
05004005	See, I have taught you statutes and ordinances just as the LORD my God has commanded me, so that you may follow them in the land that you are about to enter and possess. 
05004006	Observe them carefully, for this will show your wisdom and understanding in the sight of the peoples, who will hear of all these statutes and say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.” 
05004007	For what nation is great enough to have a god as near to them as the LORD our God is to us whenever we call on Him? 
05004008	And what nation is great enough to have righteous statutes and ordinances like this entire law I set before you today? 
05004009	Only be on your guard and diligently watch yourselves, so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen, and so that they do not slip from your heart as long as you live. Teach them to your children and grandchildren. 
05004010	The day you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb, the LORD said to me, “Gather the people before Me to hear My words, so that they may learn to fear Me all the days they live on the earth, and that they may teach them to their children.” 
05004011	You came near and stood at the base of the mountain, a mountain blazing with fire to the heavens, with black clouds and deep darkness. 
05004012	And the LORD spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of the words but saw no form; there was only a voice. 
05004013	He declared to you His covenant, which He commanded you to follow—the Ten Commandments that He wrote on two tablets of stone. 
05004014	At that time the LORD commanded me to teach you the statutes and ordinances you are to follow in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess. 
05004015	So since you saw no form of any kind on the day the LORD spoke to you out of the fire at Horeb, be careful 
05004016	that you do not act corruptly and make an idol for yourselves of any form or shape, whether in the likeness of a male or female, 
05004017	of any beast that is on the earth or bird that flies in the air, 
05004018	or of any creature that crawls on the ground or fish that is in the waters below. 
05004019	When you look to the heavens and see the sun and moon and stars—all the host of heaven—do not be enticed to bow down and worship what the LORD your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven. 
05004020	Yet the LORD has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be the people of His inheritance, as you are today. 
05004021	The LORD, however, was angry with me on account of you, and He swore that I would not cross the Jordan to enter the good land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance. 
05004022	For I will not be crossing the Jordan, because I must die in this land. But you shall cross over and take possession of that good land. 
05004023	Be careful that you do not forget the covenant of the LORD your God that He made with you; do not make an idol for yourselves in the form of anything He has forbidden you. 
05004024	For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God. 
05004025	After you have children and grandchildren and you have been in the land a long time, if you then act corruptly and make an idol of any form—doing evil in the sight of the LORD your God and provoking Him to anger— 
05004026	I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you this day that you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess. You will not live long upon it, but will be utterly destroyed. 
05004027	Then the LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and only a few of you will survive among the nations to which the LORD will drive you. 
05004028	And there you will serve man-made gods of wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or eat or smell. 
05004029	But if from there you will seek the LORD your God, you will find Him if you seek Him with all your heart and with all your soul. 
05004030	When you are in distress and all these things have happened to you, then in later days you will return to the LORD your God and listen to His voice. 
05004031	For the LORD your God is a merciful God; He will not abandon you or destroy you or forget the covenant with your fathers, which He swore to them by oath. 
05004032	Indeed, ask now from one end of the heavens to the other about the days that long preceded you, from the day that God created man on earth: Has anything as great as this ever happened or been reported? 
05004033	Has a people ever heard the voice of God speaking out of the fire, as you have, and lived? 
05004034	Or has any god tried to take as his own a nation out of another nation—by trials, signs, wonders, and war, by a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and by great terrors—as the LORD your God did for you in Egypt, before your eyes? 
05004035	You were shown these things so that you would know that the LORD is God; there is no other besides Him. 
05004036	He let you hear His voice from heaven to discipline you, and on earth He showed you His great fire, and you heard His words out of the fire. 
05004037	Because He loved your fathers, He chose their descendants after them and brought you out of Egypt by His presence and great power, 
05004038	to drive out before you nations greater and mightier than you, and to bring you into their land and give it to you for your inheritance, as it is this day. 
05004039	Know therefore this day and take to heart that the LORD is God in heaven above and on the earth below; there is no other. 
05004040	Keep His statutes and commandments, which I am giving you today, so that you and your children after you may prosper, and that you may live long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you for all time. 
05004041	Then Moses set aside three cities across the Jordan to the east 
05004042	to which a manslayer could flee after killing his neighbor unintentionally without prior malice. To save one’s own life, he could flee to one of these cities: 
05004043	Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau belonging to the Reubenites, Ramoth in Gilead belonging to the Gadites, or Golan in Bashan belonging to the Manassites. 
05004044	This is the law that Moses set before the Israelites. 
05004045	These are the testimonies, statutes, and ordinances that Moses proclaimed to them after they had come out of Egypt, 
05004046	while they were in the valley across the Jordan facing Beth-peor in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon and was defeated by Moses and the Israelites after they had come out of Egypt. 
05004047	They took possession of the land belonging to Sihon and to Og king of Bashan—the two Amorite kings across the Jordan to the east— 
05004048	extending from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley as far as Mount Siyon (that is, Hermon), 
05004049	including all the Arabah on the east side of the Jordan and as far as the Sea of the Arabah, below the slopes of Pisgah. 
05005001	Then Moses summoned all Israel and said to them: Hear, O Israel, the statutes and ordinances that I declare in your hearing this day. Learn them and observe them carefully. 
05005002	The LORD our God made a covenant with us at Horeb. 
05005003	He did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with all of us who are alive here today. 
05005004	The LORD spoke with you face to face out of the fire on the mountain. 
05005005	At that time I was standing between the LORD and you to declare to you the word of the LORD, because you were afraid of the fire and would not go up the mountain. And He said: 
05005006	“I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. 
05005007	You shall have no other gods before Me. 
05005008	You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in the heavens above, on the earth below, or in the waters beneath. 
05005009	You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on their children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, 
05005010	but showing loving devotion to a thousand generations of those who love Me and keep My commandments. 
05005011	You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not leave anyone unpunished who takes His name in vain. 
05005012	Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, as the LORD your God has commanded you. 
05005013	Six days you shall labor and do all your work, 
05005014	but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God, on which you must not do any work—neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your ox or donkey or any of your livestock, nor the foreigner within your gates, so that your manservant and maidservant may rest as you do. 
05005015	Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. That is why the LORD your God has commanded you to keep the Sabbath day. 
05005016	Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you, so that your days may be long and that it may go well with you in the land that the LORD your God is giving you. 
05005017	You shall not murder. 
05005018	You shall not commit adultery. 
05005019	You shall not steal. 
05005020	You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. 
05005021	You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife. You shall not covet your neighbor’s house or field, or his manservant or maidservant, or his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.” 
05005022	The LORD spoke these commandments in a loud voice to your whole assembly out of the fire, the cloud, and the deep darkness on the mountain; He added nothing more. And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me. 
05005023	And when you heard the voice out of the darkness while the mountain was blazing with fire, all the heads of your tribes and your elders approached me, 
05005024	and you said, “Behold, the LORD our God has shown us His glory and greatness, and we have heard His voice out of the fire. Today we have seen that a man can live even if God speaks with him. 
05005025	But now, why should we die? For this great fire will consume us, and we will die, if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any longer. 
05005026	For who of all flesh has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the fire, as we have, and survived? 
05005027	Go near and listen to all that the LORD our God says. Then you can tell us everything the LORD our God tells you; we will listen and obey.” 
05005028	And the LORD heard the words you spoke to me, and He said to me, “I have heard the words that these people have spoken to you. They have done well in all that they have spoken. 
05005029	If only they had such a heart to fear Me and keep all My commandments always, so that it might be well with them and with their children forever. 
05005030	Go and tell them: ‘Return to your tents.’ 
05005031	But you stand here with Me, that I may speak to you all the commandments and statutes and ordinances you are to teach them to follow in the land that I am giving them to possess.” 
05005032	So be careful to do as the LORD your God has commanded you; you are not to turn aside to the right or to the left. 
05005033	You must walk in all the ways that the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live and prosper and prolong your days in the land that you will possess. 
05006001	These are the commandments and statutes and ordinances that the LORD your God has instructed me to teach you to follow in the land that you are about to enter and possess, 
05006002	so that you and your children and grandchildren may fear the LORD your God all the days of your lives by keeping all His statutes and commandments that I give you, and so that your days may be prolonged. 
05006003	Hear, O Israel, and be careful to observe them, so that you may prosper and multiply greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you. 
05006004	Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is One. 
05006005	And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. 
05006006	These words I am commanding you today are to be upon your hearts. 
05006007	And you shall teach them diligently to your children and speak of them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. 
05006008	Tie them as reminders on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. 
05006009	Write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates. 
05006010	And when the LORD your God brings you into the land He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that He would give you—a land with great and splendid cities that you did not build, 
05006011	with houses full of every good thing with which you did not fill them, with wells that you did not dig, and with vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant—and when you eat and are satisfied, 
05006012	be careful not to forget the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. 
05006013	Fear the LORD your God, serve Him only, and take your oaths in His name. 
05006014	Do not follow other gods, the gods of the peoples around you. 
05006015	For the LORD your God, who is among you, is a jealous God. Otherwise the anger of the LORD your God will be kindled against you, and He will wipe you off the face of the earth. 
05006016	Do not test the LORD your God as you tested Him at Massah. 
05006017	You are to diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God and the testimonies and statutes He has given you. 
05006018	Do what is right and good in the sight of the LORD, so that it may be well with you and that you may enter and possess the good land that the LORD your God swore to give your fathers, 
05006019	driving out all your enemies before you, as the LORD has said. 
05006020	In the future, when your son asks, “What is the meaning of the decrees and statutes and ordinances that the LORD our God has commanded you?” 
05006021	then you are to tell him, “We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, but the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 
05006022	Before our eyes the LORD inflicted great and devastating signs and wonders on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his household. 
05006023	But He brought us out from there to lead us in and give us the land that He had sworn to our fathers. 
05006024	And the LORD commanded us to observe all these statutes and to fear the LORD our God, that we may always be prosperous and preserved, as we are to this day. 
05006025	And if we are careful to observe every one of these commandments before the LORD our God, as He has commanded us, then that will be our righteousness.” 
05007001	When the LORD your God brings you into the land that you are entering to possess, and He drives out before you many nations—the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, seven nations larger and stronger than you— 
05007002	and when the LORD your God has delivered them over to you to defeat them, then you must devote them to complete destruction. Make no treaty with them and show them no mercy. 
05007003	Do not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons, 
05007004	because they will turn your sons away from following Me to serve other gods. Then the anger of the LORD will burn against you, and He will swiftly destroy you. 
05007005	Instead, this is what you are to do to them: tear down their altars, smash their sacred pillars, cut down their Asherah poles, and burn their idols in the fire. 
05007006	For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for His prized possession out of all peoples on the face of the earth. 
05007007	The LORD did not set His affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than the other peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples. 
05007008	But because the LORD loved you and kept the oath He swore to your fathers, He brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 
05007009	Know therefore that the LORD your God is God, the faithful God who keeps His covenant of loving devotion for a thousand generations of those who love Him and keep His commandments. 
05007010	But those who hate Him He repays to their faces with destruction; He will not hesitate to repay to his face the one who hates Him. 
05007011	So keep the commandments and statutes and ordinances that I am giving you to follow this day. 
05007012	If you listen to these ordinances and keep them carefully, then the LORD your God will keep His covenant and the loving devotion that He swore to your fathers. 
05007013	He will love you and bless you and multiply you. He will bless the fruit of your womb and the produce of your land—your grain, new wine, and oil, the young of your herds and the lambs of your flocks—in the land that He swore to your fathers to give you. 
05007014	You will be blessed above all peoples; among you there will be no barren man or woman or livestock. 
05007015	And the LORD will remove from you all sickness. He will not lay upon you any of the terrible diseases you knew in Egypt, but He will inflict them on all who hate you. 
05007016	You must destroy all the peoples the LORD your God will deliver to you. Do not look on them with pity. Do not worship their gods, for that will be a snare to you. 
05007017	You may say in your heart, “These nations are greater than we are; how can we drive them out?” 
05007018	But do not be afraid of them. Be sure to remember what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and all Egypt: 
05007019	the great trials that you saw, the signs and wonders, and the mighty hand and outstretched arm by which the LORD your God brought you out. The LORD your God will do the same to all the peoples you now fear. 
05007020	Moreover, the LORD your God will send the hornet against them until even the survivors hiding from you have perished. 
05007021	Do not be terrified by them, for the LORD your God, who is among you, is a great and awesome God. 
05007022	The LORD your God will drive out these nations before you little by little. You will not be enabled to eliminate them all at once, or the wild animals would multiply around you. 
05007023	But the LORD your God will give them over to you and throw them into great confusion, until they are destroyed. 
05007024	He will hand their kings over to you, and you will wipe out their names from under heaven. No one will be able to stand against you; you will annihilate them. 
05007025	You must burn up the images of their gods; do not covet the silver and gold that is on them or take it for yourselves, or you will be ensnared by it; for it is detestable to the LORD your God. 
05007026	And you must not bring any detestable thing into your house, or you, like it, will be set apart for destruction. You are to utterly detest and abhor it, because it is set apart for destruction. 
05008001	You must carefully follow every commandment I am giving you today, so that you may live and multiply, and enter and possess the land that the LORD swore to give your fathers. 
05008002	Remember that these forty years the LORD your God led you all the way in the wilderness, so that He might humble you and test you in order to know what was in your heart, whether or not you would keep His commandments. 
05008003	He humbled you, and in your hunger He gave you manna to eat, which neither you nor your fathers had known, so that you might understand that man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD. 
05008004	Your clothing did not wear out and your feet did not swell during these forty years. 
05008005	So know in your heart that just as a man disciplines his son, so the LORD your God disciplines you. 
05008006	Therefore you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God, walking in His ways and fearing Him. 
05008007	For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks and fountains and springs that flow through the valleys and hills; 
05008008	a land of wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of olive oil and honey; 
05008009	a land where you will eat food without scarcity, where you will lack nothing; a land whose rocks are iron and whose hills are ready to be mined for copper. 
05008010	When you eat and are satisfied, you are to bless the LORD your God for the good land that He has given you. 
05008011	Be careful not to forget the LORD your God by failing to keep His commandments and ordinances and statutes, which I am giving you this day. 
05008012	Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, when you build fine houses in which to dwell, 
05008013	and when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all that you have is multiplied, 
05008014	then your heart will become proud, and you will forget the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. 
05008015	He led you through the vast and terrifying wilderness with its venomous snakes and scorpions, a thirsty and waterless land. He brought you water from the rock of flint. 
05008016	He fed you in the wilderness with manna that your fathers had not known, in order to humble you and test you, so that in the end He might cause you to prosper. 
05008017	You might say in your heart, “The power and strength of my hands have made this wealth for me.” 
05008018	But remember that it is the LORD your God who gives you the power to gain wealth, in order to confirm His covenant that He swore to your fathers even to this day. 
05008019	If you ever forget the LORD your God and go after other gods to worship and bow down to them, I testify against you today that you will surely perish. 
05008020	Like the nations that the LORD has destroyed before you, so you will perish if you do not obey the LORD your God. 
05009001	Hear, O Israel: Today you are about to cross the Jordan to go in and dispossess nations greater and stronger than you, with large cities fortified to the heavens. 
05009002	The people are strong and tall, the descendants of the Anakim. You know about them, and you have heard it said, “Who can stand up to the sons of Anak?” 
05009003	But understand that today the LORD your God goes across ahead of you as a consuming fire; He will destroy them and subdue them before you. And you will drive them out and annihilate them swiftly, as the LORD has promised you. 
05009004	When the LORD your God has driven them out before you, do not say in your heart, “Because of my righteousness the LORD has brought me in to possess this land.” Rather, the LORD is driving out these nations before you because of their wickedness. 
05009005	It is not because of your righteousness or uprightness of heart that you are going in to possess their land, but it is because of their wickedness that the LORD your God is driving out these nations before you, to keep the promise He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
05009006	Understand, then, that it is not because of your righteousness that the LORD your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stiff-necked people. 
05009007	Remember this, and never forget how you provoked the LORD your God in the wilderness. From the day you left the land of Egypt until you reached this place, you have been rebelling against the LORD. 
05009008	At Horeb you provoked the LORD, and He was angry enough to destroy you. 
05009009	When I went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the LORD made with you, I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I ate no bread and drank no water. 
05009010	Then the LORD gave me the two stone tablets, inscribed by the finger of God with the exact words that the LORD spoke to you out of the fire on the mountain on the day of the assembly. 
05009011	And at the end of forty days and forty nights, the LORD gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant. 
05009012	And the LORD said to me, “Get up and go down from here at once, for your people, whom you brought out of Egypt, have corrupted themselves. How quickly they have turned aside from the way that I commanded them! They have made for themselves a molten image.” 
05009013	The LORD also said to me, “I have seen this people, and they are indeed a stiff-necked people. 
05009014	Leave Me alone, so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. Then I will make you into a nation mightier and greater than they are.” 
05009015	So I went back down the mountain while it was blazing with fire, with the two tablets of the covenant in my hands. 
05009016	And I saw how you had sinned against the LORD your God; you had made for yourselves a molten calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way that the LORD had commanded you. 
05009017	So I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands, shattering them before your eyes. 
05009018	Then I fell down before the LORD for forty days and forty nights, as I had done the first time. I did not eat bread or drink water because of all the sin you had committed in doing what was evil in the sight of the LORD and provoking Him to anger. 
05009019	For I was afraid of the anger and wrath that the LORD had directed against you, enough to destroy you. But the LORD listened to me this time as well. 
05009020	The LORD was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, but at that time I also prayed for Aaron. 
05009021	And I took that sinful thing, the calf you had made, and burned it in the fire. Then I crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust, and I cast it into the stream that came down from the mountain. 
05009022	You continued to provoke the LORD at Taberah, at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah. 
05009023	And when the LORD sent you out from Kadesh-barnea, He said, “Go up and possess the land that I have given you.” But you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God. You neither believed Him nor obeyed Him. 
05009024	You have been rebelling against the LORD since the day I came to know you. 
05009025	So I fell down before the LORD for forty days and forty nights, because the LORD had said He would destroy you. 
05009026	And I prayed to the LORD and said, “O Lord GOD, do not destroy Your people, Your inheritance, whom You redeemed through Your greatness and brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 
05009027	Remember Your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Overlook the stubbornness of this people and the wickedness of their sin. 
05009028	Otherwise, those in the land from which You brought us out will say, ‘Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land He had promised them, and because He hated them, He has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.’ 
05009029	But they are Your people, Your inheritance, whom You brought out by Your great power and outstretched arm.” 
05010001	At that time the LORD said to me, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the originals, come up to Me on the mountain, and make an ark of wood. 
05010002	And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke; and you are to place them in the ark.” 
05010003	So I made an ark of acacia wood, chiseled out two stone tablets like the originals, and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hands. 
05010004	And the LORD wrote on the tablets what had been written previously, the Ten Commandments that He had spoken to you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the assembly. The LORD gave them to me, 
05010005	and I went back down the mountain and placed the tablets in the ark I had made, as the LORD had commanded me; and there they have remained. 
05010006	The Israelites traveled from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah, where Aaron died and was buried, and Eleazar his son succeeded him as priest. 
05010007	From there they traveled to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land with streams of water. 
05010008	At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to serve Him, and to pronounce blessings in His name, as they do to this day. 
05010009	That is why Levi has no portion or inheritance among his brothers; the LORD is his inheritance, as the LORD your God promised him. 
05010010	I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights, like the first time, and that time the LORD again listened to me and agreed not to destroy you. 
05010011	Then the LORD said to me, “Get up. Continue your journey ahead of the people, that they may enter and possess the land that I swore to their fathers to give them.” 
05010012	And now, O Israel, what does the LORD your God ask of you but to fear the LORD your God by walking in all His ways, to love Him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, 
05010013	and to keep the commandments and statutes of the LORD that I am giving you this day for your own good? 
05010014	Behold, to the LORD your God belong the heavens, even the highest heavens, and the earth and everything in it. 
05010015	Yet the LORD has set His affection on your fathers and loved them. And He has chosen you, their descendants after them, above all the peoples, even to this day. 
05010016	Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and stiffen your necks no more. 
05010017	For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, mighty, and awesome God, showing no partiality and accepting no bribe. 
05010018	He executes justice for the fatherless and widow, and He loves the foreigner, giving him food and clothing. 
05010019	So you also must love the foreigner, since you yourselves were foreigners in the land of Egypt. 
05010020	You are to fear the LORD your God and serve Him. Hold fast to Him and take your oaths in His name. 
05010021	He is your praise and He is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome wonders that your eyes have seen. 
05010022	Your fathers went down to Egypt, seventy in all, and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky. 
05011001	You shall therefore love the LORD your God and always keep His charge, His statutes, His ordinances, and His commandments. 
05011002	Know this day that it is not your children who have known and seen the discipline of the LORD your God: His greatness, His mighty hand, and His outstretched arm; 
05011003	the signs and works He did in Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt and all his land; 
05011004	what He did to the Egyptian army and horses and chariots when He made the waters of the Red Sea engulf them as they pursued you, and how He destroyed them completely, even to this day; 
05011005	what He did for you in the wilderness until you reached this place; 
05011006	and what He did in the midst of all the Israelites to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab the Reubenite, when the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, their households, their tents, and every living thing that belonged to them. 
05011007	For it is your own eyes that have seen every great work that the LORD has done. 
05011008	You shall therefore keep every commandment I am giving you today, so that you may have the strength to go in and possess the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess, 
05011009	and so that you may live long in the land that the LORD swore to your fathers to give them and their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
05011010	For the land that you are entering to possess is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you sowed your seed and irrigated on foot, like a vegetable garden. 
05011011	But the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess is a land of mountains and valleys that drinks in the rain from heaven. 
05011012	It is a land for which the LORD your God cares; the eyes of the LORD your God are always on it, from the beginning to the end of the year. 
05011013	So if you carefully obey the commandments I am giving you today, to love the LORD your God and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul, 
05011014	then I will provide rain for your land in season, the autumn and spring rains, that you may gather your grain, new wine, and oil. 
05011015	And I will provide grass in the fields for your livestock, and you will eat and be satisfied. 
05011016	But be careful that you are not enticed to turn aside to worship and bow down to other gods, 
05011017	or the anger of the LORD will be kindled against you. He will shut the heavens so that there will be no rain, nor will the land yield its produce, and you will soon perish from the good land that the LORD is giving you. 
05011018	Fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds; tie them as reminders on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. 
05011019	Teach them to your children, speaking about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. 
05011020	Write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates, 
05011021	so that as long as the heavens are above the earth, your days and those of your children may be multiplied in the land that the LORD swore to give your fathers. 
05011022	For if you carefully keep all these commandments I am giving you to follow—to love the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways, and to hold fast to Him— 
05011023	then the LORD will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations greater and stronger than you. 
05011024	Every place where the sole of your foot treads will be yours. Your territory will extend from the wilderness to Lebanon, and from the Euphrates River to the Western Sea. 
05011025	No man will be able to stand against you; the LORD your God will put the fear and dread of you upon all the land, wherever you set foot, as He has promised you. 
05011026	See, today I am setting before you a blessing and a curse— 
05011027	a blessing if you obey the commandments of the LORD your God that I am giving you today, 
05011028	but a curse if you disobey the commandments of the LORD your God and turn aside from the path I command you today by following other gods, which you have not known. 
05011029	When the LORD your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess, you are to proclaim the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal. 
05011030	Are not these mountains across the Jordan, west of the road toward the sunset, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah opposite Gilgal near the Oak of Moreh? 
05011031	For you are about to cross the Jordan to enter and possess the land that the LORD your God is giving you. When you take possession of it and settle in it, 
05011032	be careful to follow all the statutes and ordinances that I am setting before you today. 
05012001	These are the statutes and ordinances you must be careful to follow all the days you live in the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess. 
05012002	Destroy completely all the places where the nations you are dispossessing have served their gods—atop the high mountains, on the hills, and under every green tree. 
05012003	Tear down their altars, smash their sacred pillars, burn up their Asherah poles, cut down the idols of their gods, and wipe out their names from every place. 
05012004	You shall not worship the LORD your God in this way. 
05012005	Instead, you must seek the place the LORD your God will choose from among all your tribes to establish as a dwelling for His Name, and there you must go. 
05012006	To that place you are to bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and heave offerings, your vow offerings and freewill offerings, as well as the firstborn of your herds and flocks. 
05012007	There, in the presence of the LORD your God, you and your households shall eat and rejoice in all you do, because the LORD your God has blessed you. 
05012008	You are not to do as we are doing here today, where everyone does what seems right in his own eyes. 
05012009	For you have not yet come to the resting place and the inheritance that the LORD your God is giving you. 
05012010	When you cross the Jordan and live in the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, and He gives you rest from all the enemies around you and you dwell securely, 
05012011	then the LORD your God will choose a dwelling for His Name. And there you are to bring everything I command you: your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, and all the choice offerings you vow to the LORD. 
05012012	And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God—you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the Levite within your gates, since he has no portion or inheritance among you. 
05012013	Be careful not to offer your burnt offerings in just any place you see; 
05012014	you must offer them only in the place the LORD will choose in one of your tribal territories, and there you shall do all that I command you. 
05012015	But whenever you want, you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your gates, according to the blessing the LORD your God has given you. Both the ceremonially clean and unclean may eat it as they would a gazelle or deer, 
05012016	but you must not eat the blood; pour it on the ground like water. 
05012017	Within your gates you must not eat the tithe of your grain or new wine or oil, the firstborn of your herds or flocks, any of the offerings that you have vowed to give, or your freewill offerings or special gifts. 
05012018	Instead, you must eat them in the presence of the LORD your God at the place the LORD your God will choose—you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the Levite within your gates. Rejoice before the LORD your God in all you do, 
05012019	and be careful not to neglect the Levites as long as you live in your land. 
05012020	When the LORD your God expands your territory as He has promised, and you crave meat and say, “I want to eat meat,” you may eat it whenever you want. 
05012021	If the place where the LORD your God chooses to put His Name is too far from you, then you may slaughter any of the herd or flock He has given you, as I have commanded you, and you may eat it within your gates whenever you want. 
05012022	Indeed, you may eat it as you would eat a gazelle or deer; both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it. 
05012023	Only be sure not to eat the blood, because the blood is the life, and you must not eat the life with the meat. 
05012024	You must not eat the blood; pour it on the ground like water. 
05012025	Do not eat it, so that it may go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is right in the eyes of the LORD. 
05012026	But you are to take your holy things and your vow offerings and go to the place the LORD will choose. 
05012027	Present the meat and blood of your burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD your God. The blood of your other sacrifices must be poured out beside the altar of the LORD your God, but you may eat the meat. 
05012028	Be careful to obey all these things I command you, so that it may always go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is good and right in the eyes of the LORD your God. 
05012029	When the LORD your God cuts off before you the nations you are entering to dispossess, and you drive them out and live in their land, 
05012030	be careful not to be ensnared by their ways after they have been destroyed before you. Do not inquire about their gods, asking, “How do these nations serve their gods? I will do likewise.” 
05012031	You must not worship the LORD your God in this way, because they practice for their gods every abomination which the LORD hates. They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire as sacrifices to their gods. 
05012032	See that you do everything I command you; do not add to it or subtract from it. 
05013001	If a prophet or dreamer of dreams arises among you and proclaims a sign or wonder to you, 
05013002	and if the sign or wonder he has spoken to you comes about, but he says, “Let us follow other gods (which you have not known) and let us worship them,” 
05013003	you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer. For the LORD your God is testing you to find out whether you love Him with all your heart and with all your soul. 
05013004	You are to follow the LORD your God and fear Him. Keep His commandments and listen to His voice; serve Him and hold fast to Him. 
05013005	Such a prophet or dreamer must be put to death, because he has advocated rebellion against the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery; he has tried to turn you from the way in which the LORD your God has commanded you to walk. So you must purge the evil from among you. 
05013006	If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you embrace, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, “Let us go and worship other gods” (which neither you nor your fathers have known, 
05013007	the gods of the peoples around you, whether near or far, whether from one end of the earth or the other), 
05013008	you must not yield to him or listen to him. Show him no pity, and do not spare him or shield him. 
05013009	Instead, you must surely kill him. Your hand must be the first against him to put him to death, and then the hands of all the people. 
05013010	Stone him to death for trying to turn you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. 
05013011	Then all Israel will hear and be afraid, and will never again do such a wicked thing among you. 
05013012	If, regarding one of the cities the LORD your God is giving you to inhabit, you hear it said 
05013013	that wicked men have arisen from among you and have led the people of their city astray, saying, “Let us go and serve other gods” (which you have not known), 
05013014	then you must inquire, investigate, and interrogate thoroughly. And if it is established with certainty that this abomination has been committed among you, 
05013015	you must surely put the inhabitants of that city to the sword. Devote to destruction all its people and livestock. 
05013016	And you are to gather all its plunder in the middle of the public square, and completely burn the city and all its plunder as a whole burnt offering to the LORD your God. The city must remain a mound of ruins forever, never to be rebuilt. 
05013017	Nothing devoted to destruction shall cling to your hands, so that the LORD will turn from His fierce anger, grant you mercy, show you compassion, and multiply you as He swore to your fathers, 
05013018	because you obey the LORD your God, keeping all His commandments I am giving you today and doing what is right in the eyes of the LORD your God. 
05014001	You are sons of the LORD your God; do not cut yourselves or shave your foreheads on behalf of the dead, 
05014002	for you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD has chosen you to be a people for His prized possession out of all the peoples on the face of the earth. 
05014003	You must not eat any detestable thing. 
05014004	These are the animals that you may eat: The ox, the sheep, the goat, 
05014005	the deer, the gazelle, the roe deer, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope, and the mountain sheep. 
05014006	You may eat any animal that has a split hoof divided in two and that chews the cud. 
05014007	But of those that chew the cud or have a completely divided hoof, you are not to eat the following: the camel, the rabbit, or the rock badger. Although they chew the cud, they do not have a divided hoof. They are unclean for you, 
05014008	as well as the pig; though it has a divided hoof, it does not chew the cud. It is unclean for you. You must not eat its meat or touch its carcass. 
05014009	Of all the creatures that live in the water, you may eat anything with fins and scales, 
05014010	but you may not eat anything that does not have fins and scales; it is unclean for you. 
05014011	You may eat any clean bird, 
05014012	but these you may not eat: the eagle, the bearded vulture, the black vulture, 
05014013	the red kite, the falcon, any kind of kite, 
05014014	any kind of raven, 
05014015	the ostrich, the screech owl, the gull, any kind of hawk, 
05014016	the little owl, the great owl, the white owl, 
05014017	the desert owl, the osprey, the cormorant, 
05014018	the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe, or the bat. 
05014019	All flying insects are unclean for you; they may not be eaten. 
05014020	But you may eat any clean bird. 
05014021	You are not to eat any carcass; you may give it to the foreigner residing within your gates, and he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner. For you are a holy people belonging to the LORD your God. You must not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk. 
05014022	You must be sure to set aside a tenth of all the produce brought forth each year from your fields. 
05014023	And you are to eat a tenth of your grain, new wine, and oil, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks, in the presence of the LORD your God at the place He will choose as a dwelling for His Name, so that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always. 
05014024	But if the distance is too great for you to carry that with which the LORD your God has blessed you, because the place where the LORD your God will choose to put His Name is too far away, 
05014025	then exchange it for money, take the money in your hand, and go to the place the LORD your God will choose. 
05014026	Then you may spend the money on anything you desire: cattle, sheep, wine, strong drink, or anything you wish. You are to feast there in the presence of the LORD your God and rejoice with your household. 
05014027	And do not neglect the Levite within your gates, since he has no portion or inheritance among you. 
05014028	At the end of every three years, bring a tenth of all your produce for that year and lay it up within your gates. 
05014029	Then the Levite (because he has no portion or inheritance among you), the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow within your gates may come and eat and be satisfied. And the LORD your God will bless you in all the work of your hands. 
05015001	At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts. 
05015002	This is the manner of remission: Every creditor shall cancel what he has loaned to his neighbor. He is not to collect anything from his neighbor or brother, because the LORD’s time of release has been proclaimed. 
05015003	You may collect something from a foreigner, but you must forgive whatever your brother owes you. 
05015004	There will be no poor among you, however, because the LORD will surely bless you in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance, 
05015005	if only you obey the LORD your God and are careful to follow all these commandments I am giving you today. 
05015006	When the LORD your God blesses you as He has promised, you will lend to many nations but borrow from none; you will rule over many nations but be ruled by none. 
05015007	If there is a poor man among your brothers within any of the gates in the land that the LORD your God is giving you, then you are not to harden your heart or shut your hand from your poor brother. 
05015008	Instead, you are to open your hand to him and freely loan him whatever he needs. 
05015009	Be careful not to harbor this wicked thought in your heart: “The seventh year, the year of release, is near,” so that you look upon your poor brother begrudgingly and give him nothing. He will cry out to the LORD against you, and you will be guilty of sin. 
05015010	Give generously to him, and do not let your heart be grieved when you do so. And because of this the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in everything to which you put your hand. 
05015011	For there will never cease to be poor in the land; that is why I am commanding you to open wide your hand to your brother and to the poor and needy in your land. 
05015012	If a fellow Hebrew, a man or a woman, is sold to you and serves you six years, then in the seventh year you must set him free. 
05015013	And when you release him, do not send him away empty-handed. 
05015014	You are to furnish him liberally from your flock, your threshing floor, and your winepress. You shall give to him as the LORD your God has blessed you. 
05015015	Remember that you were slaves in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you; that is why I am giving you this command today. 
05015016	But if your servant says to you, ‘I do not want to leave you,’ because he loves you and your household and is well off with you, 
05015017	then take an awl and pierce it through his ear into the door, and he will become your servant for life. And treat your maidservant the same way. 
05015018	Do not regard it as a hardship to set your servant free, because his six years of service were worth twice the wages of a hired hand. And the LORD your God will bless you in all you do. 
05015019	You must set apart to the LORD your God every firstborn male produced by your herds and flocks. You are not to put the firstborn of your oxen to work, nor are you to shear the firstborn of your flock. 
05015020	Each year you and your household are to eat it before the LORD your God in the place the LORD will choose. 
05015021	But if an animal has a defect, is lame or blind, or has any serious flaw, you must not sacrifice it to the LORD your God. 
05015022	Eat it within your gates; both the ceremonially unclean and clean may eat it as they would a gazelle or a deer. 
05015023	But you must not eat the blood; pour it on the ground like water. 
05016001	Observe the month of Abib and celebrate the Passover to the LORD your God, because in the month of Abib the LORD your God brought you out of Egypt by night. 
05016002	You are to offer to the LORD your God the Passover sacrifice from the herd or flock in the place the LORD will choose as a dwelling for His Name. 
05016003	You must not eat leavened bread with it; for seven days you are to eat with it unleavened bread, the bread of affliction, because you left the land of Egypt in haste—so that you may remember for the rest of your life the day you left the land of Egypt. 
05016004	No leaven is to be found in all your land for seven days, and none of the meat you sacrifice in the evening of the first day shall remain until morning. 
05016005	You are not to sacrifice the Passover animal in any of the towns that the LORD your God is giving you. 
05016006	You must only offer the Passover sacrifice at the place the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for His Name. Do this in the evening as the sun sets, at the same time you departed from Egypt. 
05016007	And you shall roast it and eat it in the place the LORD your God will choose, and in the morning you shall return to your tents. 
05016008	For six days you must eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day you shall hold a solemn assembly to the LORD your God, and you must not do any work. 
05016009	You are to count off seven weeks from the time you first put the sickle to the standing grain. 
05016010	And you shall celebrate the Feast of Weeks to the LORD your God with a freewill offering that you give in proportion to how the LORD your God has blessed you, 
05016011	and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in the place He will choose as a dwelling for His Name—you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the Levite within your gates, as well as the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widows among you. 
05016012	Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, and carefully follow these statutes. 
05016013	You are to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days after you have gathered the produce of your threshing floor and your winepress. 
05016014	And you shall rejoice in your feast—you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the Levite, as well as the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widows among you. 
05016015	For seven days you shall celebrate a feast to the LORD your God in the place He will choose, because the LORD your God will bless you in all your produce and in all the work of your hands, so that your joy will be complete. 
05016016	Three times a year all your men are to appear before the LORD your God in the place He will choose: at the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles. No one should appear before the LORD empty-handed. 
05016017	Everyone must appear with a gift as he is able, according to the blessing the LORD your God has given you. 
05016018	You are to appoint judges and officials for your tribes in every town that the LORD your God is giving you. They are to judge the people with righteous judgment. 
05016019	Do not deny justice or show partiality. Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the righteous. 
05016020	Pursue justice, and justice alone, so that you may live, and you may possess the land that the LORD your God is giving you. 
05016021	Do not set up any wooden Asherah pole next to the altar you will build for the LORD your God, 
05016022	and do not set up for yourselves a sacred pillar, which the LORD your God hates. 
05017001	You shall not sacrifice to the LORD your God an ox or a sheep with any defect or serious flaw, for that is detestable to the LORD your God. 
05017002	If a man or woman among you in one of the towns that the LORD your God gives you is found doing evil in the sight of the LORD your God by transgressing His covenant 
05017003	and going to worship other gods, bowing down to them or to the sun or moon or any of the host of heaven—which I have forbidden— 
05017004	and if it is reported and you hear about it, you must investigate it thoroughly. If the report is true and such an abomination has happened in Israel, 
05017005	you must bring out to your gates the man or woman who has done this evil thing, and you must stone that person to death. 
05017006	On the testimony of two or three witnesses a man shall be put to death, but he shall not be executed on the testimony of a lone witness. 
05017007	The hands of the witnesses shall be the first in putting him to death, and after that, the hands of all the people. So you must purge the evil from among you. 
05017008	If a case is too difficult for you to judge, whether the controversy within your gates is regarding bloodshed, lawsuits, or assaults, you must go up to the place the LORD your God will choose. 
05017009	You are to go to the Levitical priests and to the judge who presides at that time. Inquire of them, and they will give you a verdict in the case. 
05017010	You must abide by the verdict they give you at the place the LORD will choose. Be careful to do everything they instruct you, 
05017011	according to the terms of law they give and the verdict they proclaim. Do not turn aside to the right or to the left from the decision they declare to you. 
05017012	But the man who acts presumptuously, refusing to listen either to the priest who stands there to serve the LORD your God, or to the judge, must be put to death. You must purge the evil from Israel. 
05017013	Then all the people will hear and be afraid, and will no longer behave arrogantly. 
05017014	When you enter the land that the LORD your God is giving you and have taken possession of it and settled in it, and you say, “Let us set a king over us like all the nations around us,” 
05017015	you are to appoint over yourselves the king whom the LORD your God shall choose. Appoint a king from among your brothers; you are not to set over yourselves a foreigner who is not one of your brothers. 
05017016	But the king must not acquire many horses for himself or send the people back to Egypt to acquire more horses, for the LORD has said, ‘You are never to go back that way again.’ 
05017017	He must not take many wives for himself, lest his heart go astray. He must not accumulate for himself large amounts of silver and gold. 
05017018	When he is seated on his royal throne, he must write for himself a copy of this instruction on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests. 
05017019	It is to remain with him, and he is to read from it all the days of his life, so that he may learn to fear the LORD his God by carefully observing all the words of this instruction and these statutes. 
05017020	Then his heart will not be exalted above his countrymen, and he will not turn aside from the commandment, to the right or to the left, in order that he and his sons may reign many years over his kingdom in Israel. 
05018001	The Levitical priests—indeed the whole tribe of Levi—shall have no portion or inheritance with Israel. They are to eat the food offerings to the LORD; that is their inheritance. 
05018002	Although they have no inheritance among their brothers, the LORD is their inheritance, as He promised them. 
05018003	This shall be the priests’ share from the people who offer a sacrifice, whether a bull or a sheep: the priests are to be given the shoulder, the jowls, and the stomach. 
05018004	You are to give them the firstfruits of your grain, new wine, and oil, and the first wool sheared from your flock. 
05018005	For the LORD your God has chosen Levi and his sons out of all your tribes to stand and minister in His name for all time. 
05018006	Now if a Levite moves from any town of residence throughout Israel and comes in all earnestness to the place the LORD will choose, 
05018007	then he shall serve in the name of the LORD his God like all his fellow Levites who stand there before the LORD. 
05018008	They shall eat equal portions, even though he has received money from the sale of his father’s estate. 
05018009	When you enter the land that the LORD your God is giving you, do not imitate the detestable ways of the nations there. 
05018010	Let no one be found among you who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire, practices divination or conjury, interprets omens, practices sorcery, 
05018011	casts spells, consults a medium or spiritist, or inquires of the dead. 
05018012	For whoever does these things is detestable to the LORD. And because of these detestable things, the LORD your God is driving out the nations before you. 
05018013	You must be blameless before the LORD your God. 
05018014	Though these nations, which you will dispossess, listen to conjurers and diviners, the LORD your God has not permitted you to do so. 
05018015	The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers. You must listen to him. 
05018016	This is what you asked of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly, when you said, “Let us not hear the voice of the LORD our God or see this great fire anymore, so that we will not die!” 
05018017	Then the LORD said to me, “They have spoken well. 
05018018	I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. I will put My words in his mouth, and he will tell them everything I command him. 
05018019	And I will hold accountable anyone who does not listen to My words that the prophet speaks in My name. 
05018020	But if any prophet dares to speak a message in My name that I have not commanded him to speak, or to speak in the name of other gods, that prophet must be put to death.” 
05018021	You may ask in your heart, “How can we recognize a message that the LORD has not spoken?” 
05018022	When a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD and the message does not come to pass or come true, that is a message the LORD has not spoken. The prophet has spoken presumptuously. Do not be afraid of him. 
05019001	When the LORD your God has cut off the nations whose land He is giving you, and when you have driven them out and settled in their cities and houses, 
05019002	then you are to set apart for yourselves three cities within the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess. 
05019003	You are to build roads for yourselves and divide into three regions the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, so that any manslayer can flee to these cities. 
05019004	Now this is the situation regarding the manslayer who flees to one of these cities to save his life, having killed his neighbor accidentally, without intending to harm him: 
05019005	If he goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut timber and swings his axe to chop down a tree, but the blade flies off the handle and strikes and kills his neighbor, he may flee to one of these cities to save his life. 
05019006	Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue the manslayer in a rage, overtake him if the distance is great, and strike him dead though he did not deserve to die, since he did not intend any harm. 
05019007	This is why I am commanding you to set apart for yourselves three cities. 
05019008	And if the LORD your God enlarges your territory, as He swore to your fathers, and gives you all the land He promised them, 
05019009	and if you carefully keep all these commandments I am giving you today, loving the LORD your God and walking in His ways at all times, then you are to add three more cities to these three. 
05019010	Thus innocent blood will not be shed in the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, so that you will not be guilty of bloodshed. 
05019011	If, however, a man hates his neighbor and lies in wait, attacks him and kills him, and then flees to one of these cities, 
05019012	the elders of his city must send for him, bring him back, and hand him over to the avenger of blood to die. 
05019013	You must show him no pity. You are to purge from Israel the guilt of shedding innocent blood, that it may go well with you. 
05019014	You must not move your neighbor’s boundary marker, which was set up by your ancestors to mark the inheritance you shall receive in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess. 
05019015	A lone witness is not sufficient to establish any wrongdoing or sin against a man, regardless of what offense he may have committed. A matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses. 
05019016	If a false witness testifies against someone, accusing him of a crime, 
05019017	both parties to the dispute must stand in the presence of the LORD, before the priests and judges who are in office at that time. 
05019018	The judges shall investigate thoroughly, and if the witness is proven to be a liar who has falsely accused his brother, 
05019019	you must do to him as he intended to do to his brother. So you must purge the evil from among you. 
05019020	Then the rest of the people will hear and be afraid, and they will never again do anything so evil among you. 
05019021	You must show no pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, and foot for foot. 
05020001	When you go out to war against your enemies and see horses, chariots, and an army larger than yours, do not be afraid of them; for the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, is with you. 
05020002	When you are about to go into battle, the priest is to come forward and address the army, 
05020003	saying to them, “Hear, O Israel, today you are going into battle with your enemies. Do not be fainthearted or afraid; do not be alarmed or terrified because of them. 
05020004	For the LORD your God goes with you to fight for you against your enemies, to give you the victory.” 
05020005	Furthermore, the officers are to address the army, saying, “Has any man built a new house and not dedicated it? Let him return home, or he may die in battle and another man dedicate it. 
05020006	Has any man planted a vineyard and not begun to enjoy its fruit? Let him return home, or he may die in battle and another man enjoy its fruit. 
05020007	Has any man become pledged to a woman and not married her? Let him return home, or he may die in battle and another man marry her.” 
05020008	Then the officers shall speak further to the army, saying, “Is any man afraid or fainthearted? Let him return home, so that the hearts of his brothers will not melt like his own.” 
05020009	When the officers have finished addressing the army, they are to appoint commanders to lead it. 
05020010	When you approach a city to fight against it, you are to make an offer of peace. 
05020011	If they accept your offer of peace and open their gates, all the people there will become forced laborers to serve you. 
05020012	But if they refuse to make peace with you and wage war against you, lay siege to that city. 
05020013	When the LORD your God has delivered it into your hand, you must put every male to the sword. 
05020014	But the women, children, livestock, and whatever else is in the city—all its spoil—you may take as plunder, and you shall use the spoil of your enemies that the LORD your God gives you. 
05020015	This is how you are to treat all the cities that are far away from you and do not belong to the nations nearby. 
05020016	However, in the cities of the nations that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, you must not leave alive anything that breathes. 
05020017	For you must devote them to complete destruction —the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—as the LORD your God has commanded you, 
05020018	so that they cannot teach you to do all the detestable things they do for their gods, and so cause you to sin against the LORD your God. 
05020019	When you lay siege to a city for an extended time while fighting against it to capture it, you must not destroy its trees by putting an axe to them, because you can eat their fruit. You must not cut them down. Are the trees of the field human, that you should besiege them? 
05020020	But you may destroy the trees that you know do not produce fruit. Use them to build siege works against the city that is waging war against you, until it falls. 
05021001	If one is found slain, lying in a field in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess, and it is not known who killed him, 
05021002	your elders and judges must come out and measure the distance from the victim to the neighboring cities. 
05021003	Then the elders of the city nearest the victim shall take a heifer that has never been yoked or used for work, 
05021004	bring the heifer to a valley with running water that has not been plowed or sown, and break its neck there by the stream. 
05021005	And the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come forward, for the LORD your God has chosen them to serve Him and pronounce blessings in His name and to give a ruling in every dispute and case of assault. 
05021006	Then all the elders of the city nearest the victim shall wash their hands by the stream over the heifer whose neck has been broken, 
05021007	and they shall declare, “Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it. 
05021008	Accept this atonement, O LORD, for Your people Israel whom You have redeemed, and do not hold the shedding of innocent blood against them.” And the bloodshed will be atoned for. 
05021009	So you shall purge from among you the guilt of shedding innocent blood, since you have done what is right in the eyes of the LORD. 
05021010	When you go to war against your enemies and the LORD your God delivers them into your hand and you take them captive, 
05021011	if you see a beautiful woman among them, and you desire her and want to take her as your wife, 
05021012	then you shall bring her into your house. She must shave her head, trim her nails, 
05021013	and put aside the clothing of her captivity. After she has lived in your house a full month and mourned her father and mother, you may have relations with her and be her husband, and she shall be your wife. 
05021014	And if you are not pleased with her, you are to let her go wherever she wishes. But you must not sell her for money or treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored her. 
05021015	If a man has two wives, one beloved and the other unloved, and both bear him sons, but the unloved wife has the firstborn son, 
05021016	when that man assigns his inheritance to his sons he must not appoint the son of the beloved wife as the firstborn over the son of the unloved wife. 
05021017	Instead, he must acknowledge the firstborn, the son of his unloved wife, by giving him a double portion of all that he has. For that son is the firstfruits of his father’s strength; the right of the firstborn belongs to him. 
05021018	If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and does not listen to them when disciplined, 
05021019	his father and mother are to lay hold of him and bring him to the elders of his city, to the gate of his hometown, 
05021020	and say to the elders, “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he does not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.” 
05021021	Then all the men of his city will stone him to death. So you must purge the evil from among you, and all Israel will hear and be afraid. 
05021022	If a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he is executed, and you hang his body on a tree, 
05021023	you must not leave the body on the tree overnight, but you must be sure to bury him that day, because anyone who is hung on a tree is under God’s curse. You must not defile the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance. 
05022001	If you see your brother’s ox or sheep straying, you must not ignore it; be sure to return it to your brother. 
05022002	If your brother does not live near you, or if you do not know who he is, you are to take the animal home to remain with you until your brother comes seeking it; then you can return it to him. 
05022003	And you shall do the same for his donkey, his cloak, or anything your brother has lost and you have found. You must not ignore it. 
05022004	If you see your brother’s donkey or ox fallen on the road, you must not ignore it; you must help him lift it up. 
05022005	A woman must not wear men’s clothing, and a man must not wear women’s clothing, for whoever does these things is detestable to the LORD your God. 
05022006	If you come across a bird’s nest with chicks or eggs, either in a tree or on the ground along the road, and the mother is sitting on the chicks or eggs, you must not take the mother along with the young. 
05022007	You may take the young, but be sure to let the mother go, so that it may be well with you and that you may prolong your days. 
05022008	If you build a new house, you are to construct a railing around your roof, so that you do not bring bloodguilt on your house if someone falls from it. 
05022009	Do not plant your vineyard with two types of seed; if you do, the entire harvest will be defiled —both the crop you plant and the fruit of your vineyard. 
05022010	Do not plow with an ox and a donkey yoked together. 
05022011	Do not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together. 
05022012	You are to make tassels on the four corners of the cloak you wear. 
05022013	Suppose a man marries a woman, has relations with her, and comes to hate her, 
05022014	and he then accuses her of shameful conduct and gives her a bad name, saying, “I married this woman and had relations with her, but I discovered she was not a virgin.” 
05022015	Then the young woman’s father and mother shall bring the proof of her virginity to the city elders at the gate 
05022016	and say to the elders, “I gave my daughter in marriage to this man, but he has come to hate her. 
05022017	And now he has accused her of shameful conduct, saying, ‘I discovered that your daughter was not a virgin.’ But here is the proof of her virginity.” And they shall spread out the cloth before the city elders. 
05022018	Then the elders of that city shall take the man and punish him. 
05022019	They are also to fine him a hundred shekels of silver and give them to the young woman’s father, because this man has given a virgin of Israel a bad name. And she shall remain his wife; he must not divorce her as long as he lives. 
05022020	If, however, this accusation is true, and no proof of the young woman’s virginity can be found, 
05022021	she shall be brought to the door of her father’s house, and there the men of her city will stone her to death. For she has committed an outrage in Israel by being promiscuous in her father’s house. So you must purge the evil from among you. 
05022022	If a man is found lying with another man’s wife, both the man who slept with her and the woman must die. You must purge the evil from Israel. 
05022023	If there is a virgin pledged in marriage to a man, and another man encounters her in the city and sleeps with her, 
05022024	you must take both of them out to the gate of that city and stone them to death—the young woman because she did not cry out in the city, and the man because he has violated his neighbor’s wife. So you must purge the evil from among you. 
05022025	But if the man encounters a betrothed woman in the open country, and he overpowers her and lies with her, only the man who has done this must die. 
05022026	Do nothing to the young woman, because she has committed no sin worthy of death. This case is just like one in which a man attacks his neighbor and murders him. 
05022027	When he found her in the field, the betrothed woman cried out, but there was no one to save her. 
05022028	If a man encounters a virgin who is not pledged in marriage, and he seizes her and lies with her, and they are discovered, 
05022029	then the man who lay with her must pay the young woman’s father fifty shekels of silver, and she must become his wife because he has violated her. He must not divorce her as long as he lives. 
05022030	A man is not to marry his father’s wife, so that he will not dishonor his father’s marriage bed. 
05023001	No man with crushed or severed genitals may enter the assembly of the LORD. 
05023002	No one of illegitimate birth may enter the assembly of the LORD, nor may any of his descendants, even to the tenth generation. 
05023003	No Ammonite or Moabite or any of their descendants may enter the assembly of the LORD, even to the tenth generation. 
05023004	For they did not meet you with food and water on your way out of Egypt, and they hired Balaam son of Beor from Pethor in Aram-naharaim to curse you. 
05023005	Yet the LORD your God would not listen to Balaam, and the LORD your God turned the curse into a blessing for you, because the LORD your God loves you. 
05023006	You are not to seek peace or prosperity from them as long as you live. 
05023007	Do not despise an Edomite, for he is your brother. Do not despise an Egyptian, because you lived as a foreigner in his land. 
05023008	The third generation of children born to them may enter the assembly of the LORD. 
05023009	When you are encamped against your enemies, then you shall keep yourself from every wicked thing. 
05023010	If any man among you becomes unclean because of a nocturnal emission, he must leave the camp and stay outside. 
05023011	When evening approaches, he must wash with water, and when the sun sets he may return to the camp. 
05023012	You must have a place outside the camp to go and relieve yourself. 
05023013	And you must have a digging tool in your equipment so that when you relieve yourself you can dig a hole and cover up your excrement. 
05023014	For the LORD your God walks throughout your camp to protect you and deliver your enemies to you. Your camp must be holy, lest He see anything unclean among you and turn away from you. 
05023015	Do not return a slave to his master if he has taken refuge with you. 
05023016	Let him live among you wherever he chooses, in the town of his pleasing. Do not oppress him. 
05023017	No daughter or son of Israel is to be a shrine prostitute. 
05023018	You must not bring the wages of a prostitute, whether female or male, into the house of the LORD your God to fulfill any vow, because both are detestable to the LORD your God. 
05023019	Do not charge your brother interest on money, food, or any other type of loan. 
05023020	You may charge a foreigner interest, but not your brother, so that the LORD your God may bless you in everything to which you put your hand in the land that you are entering to possess. 
05023021	If you make a vow to the LORD your God, do not be slow to keep it, because He will surely require it of you, and you will be guilty of sin. 
05023022	But if you refrain from making a vow, you will not be guilty of sin. 
05023023	Be careful to follow through on what comes from your lips, because you have freely vowed to the LORD your God with your own mouth. 
05023024	When you enter your neighbor’s vineyard, you may eat your fill of grapes, but you must not put any in your basket. 
05023025	When you enter your neighbor’s grainfield, you may pluck the heads of grain with your hand, but you must not put a sickle to your neighbor’s grain. 
05024001	If a man marries a woman, but she becomes displeasing to him because he finds some indecency in her, he may write her a certificate of divorce, hand it to her, and send her away from his house. 
05024002	If, after leaving his house, she goes and becomes another man’s wife, 
05024003	and the second man hates her, writes her a certificate of divorce, hands it to her, and sends her away from his house, or if he dies, 
05024004	then the husband who divorced her first may not remarry her after she has been defiled, for that is an abomination to the LORD. You must not bring sin upon the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance. 
05024005	If a man is newly married, he must not be sent to war or be pressed into any duty. For one year he is free to stay at home and bring joy to the wife he has married. 
05024006	Do not take a pair of millstones or even an upper millstone as security for a debt, because that would be taking one’s livelihood as security. 
05024007	If a man is caught kidnapping one of his Israelite brothers, whether he treats him as a slave or sells him, the kidnapper must die. So you must purge the evil from among you. 
05024008	In cases of infectious skin diseases, be careful to diligently follow everything the Levitical priests instruct you. Be careful to do as I have commanded them. 
05024009	Remember what the LORD your God did to Miriam on the journey after you came out of Egypt. 
05024010	When you lend anything to your neighbor, do not enter his house to collect security. 
05024011	You are to stand outside while the man to whom you are lending brings the security out to you. 
05024012	If he is a poor man, you must not go to sleep with the security in your possession; 
05024013	be sure to return it to him by sunset, so that he may sleep in his own cloak and bless you, and this will be credited to you as righteousness before the LORD your God. 
05024014	Do not oppress a hired hand who is poor and needy, whether he is a brother or a foreigner residing in one of your towns. 
05024015	You are to pay his wages each day before sunset, because he is poor and depends on them. Otherwise he may cry out to the LORD against you, and you will be guilty of sin. 
05024016	Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor children for their fathers; each is to die for his own sin. 
05024017	Do not deny justice to the foreigner or the fatherless, and do not take a widow’s cloak as security. 
05024018	Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you from that place. Therefore I am commanding you to do this. 
05024019	If you are harvesting in your field and forget a sheaf there, do not go back to get it. It is to be left for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, so that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands. 
05024020	When you beat the olives from your trees, you must not go over the branches again. What remains will be for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow. 
05024021	When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you must not go over the vines again. What remains will be for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow. 
05024022	Remember that you were slaves in the land of Egypt. Therefore I am commanding you to do this. 
05025001	If there is a dispute between men, they are to go to court to be judged, so that the innocent may be acquitted and the guilty condemned. 
05025002	If the guilty man deserves to be beaten, the judge shall have him lie down and be flogged in his presence with the number of lashes his crime warrants. 
05025003	He may receive no more than forty lashes, lest your brother be beaten any more than that and be degraded in your sight. 
05025004	Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain. 
05025005	When brothers dwell together and one of them dies without a son, the widow must not marry outside the family. Her husband’s brother is to take her as his wife and fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law for her. 
05025006	The first son she bears will carry on the name of the dead brother, so that his name will not be blotted out from Israel. 
05025007	But if the man does not want to marry his brother’s widow, she is to go to the elders at the city gate and say, “My husband’s brother refuses to preserve his brother’s name in Israel. He is not willing to perform the duty of a brother-in-law for me.” 
05025008	Then the elders of his city shall summon him and speak with him. If he persists and says, “I do not want to marry her,” 
05025009	his brother’s widow shall go up to him in the presence of the elders, remove his sandal, spit in his face, and declare, “This is what is done to the man who will not maintain his brother’s line.” 
05025010	And his family name in Israel will be called “The House of the Unsandaled.” 
05025011	If two men are fighting, and the wife of one comes to rescue her husband from the one striking him, and she reaches out her hand and grabs his genitals, 
05025012	you are to cut off her hand. You must show her no pity. 
05025013	You shall not have two differing weights in your bag, one heavy and one light. 
05025014	You shall not have two differing measures in your house, one large and one small. 
05025015	You must maintain accurate and honest weights and measures, so that you may live long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you. 
05025016	For everyone who behaves dishonestly in regard to these things is detestable to the LORD your God. 
05025017	Remember what the Amalekites did to you along your way from Egypt, 
05025018	how they met you on your journey when you were tired and weary, and they attacked all your stragglers; they had no fear of God. 
05025019	When the LORD your God gives you rest from the enemies around you in the land that He is giving you to possess as an inheritance, you are to blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven. Do not forget! 
05026001	When you enter the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, and you take possession of it and settle in it, 
05026002	you are to take some of the firstfruits of all your produce from the soil of the land that the LORD your God is giving you and put them in a basket. Then go to the place the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for His Name, 
05026003	to the priest who is serving at that time, and say to him, “I declare today to the LORD your God that I have entered the land that the LORD swore to our fathers to give us.” 
05026004	Then the priest shall take the basket from your hands and place it before the altar of the LORD your God, 
05026005	and you are to declare before the LORD your God, “My father was a wandering Aramean, and he went down to Egypt few in number and lived there and became a great nation, mighty and numerous. 
05026006	But the Egyptians mistreated us and afflicted us, putting us to hard labor. 
05026007	So we called out to the LORD, the God of our fathers; and the LORD heard our voice and saw our affliction, toil, and oppression. 
05026008	Then the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with great terror, signs, and wonders. 
05026009	And He brought us to this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
05026010	And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land that You, O LORD, have given me.” Then you are to place the basket before the LORD your God and bow down before Him. 
05026011	So you shall rejoice—you, the Levite, and the foreigner dwelling among you—in all the good things the LORD your God has given to you and your household. 
05026012	When you have finished laying aside a tenth of all your produce in the third year, the year of the tithe, you are to give it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat and be filled within your gates. 
05026013	Then you shall declare in the presence of the LORD your God, “I have removed from my house the sacred portion and have given it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, according to all the commandments You have given me. I have not transgressed or forgotten Your commandments. 
05026014	I have not eaten any of the sacred portion while in mourning, or removed any of it while unclean, or offered any of it for the dead. I have obeyed the LORD my God; I have done everything You commanded me. 
05026015	Look down from Your holy habitation, from heaven, and bless Your people Israel and the land You have given us as You swore to our fathers—a land flowing with milk and honey.” 
05026016	The LORD your God commands you this day to follow these statutes and ordinances. You must be careful to follow them with all your heart and with all your soul. 
05026017	Today you have proclaimed that the LORD is your God and that you will walk in His ways, keep His statutes and commandments and ordinances, and listen to His voice. 
05026018	And today the LORD has proclaimed that you are His people and treasured possession as He promised, that you are to keep all His commandments, 
05026019	that He will set you high in praise and name and honor above all the nations He has made, and that you will be a holy people to the LORD your God, as He has promised. 
05027001	Then Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people: “Keep all the commandments I am giving you today. 
05027002	And on the day you cross the Jordan into the land that the LORD your God is giving you, set up large stones and coat them with plaster. 
05027003	Write on them all the words of this law when you have crossed over to enter the land that the LORD your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you. 
05027004	And when you have crossed the Jordan, you are to set up these stones on Mount Ebal, as I am commanding you today, and you are to coat them with plaster. 
05027005	Moreover, you are to build there an altar to the LORD your God, an altar of stones. You must not use any iron tool on them. 
05027006	You shall build the altar of the LORD your God with uncut stones and offer upon it burnt offerings to the LORD your God. 
05027007	There you are to sacrifice your peace offerings, eating them and rejoicing in the presence of the LORD your God. 
05027008	And you shall write distinctly upon these stones all the words of this law.” 
05027009	Then Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all Israel: “Be silent, O Israel, and listen! This day you have become the people of the LORD your God. 
05027010	You shall therefore obey the voice of the LORD your God and follow His commandments and statutes I am giving you today.” 
05027011	On that day Moses commanded the people: 
05027012	“When you have crossed the Jordan, these tribes shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin. 
05027013	And these tribes shall stand on Mount Ebal to deliver the curse: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali. 
05027014	Then the Levites shall proclaim in a loud voice to every Israelite: 
05027015	‘Cursed is the man who makes a carved idol or molten image—an abomination to the LORD, the work of the hands of a craftsman—and sets it up in secret.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’ 
05027016	‘Cursed is he who dishonors his father or mother.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’ 
05027017	‘Cursed is he who moves his neighbor’s boundary stone.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’ 
05027018	‘Cursed is he who lets a blind man wander in the road.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’ 
05027019	‘Cursed is he who withholds justice from the foreigner, the fatherless, or the widow.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’ 
05027020	‘Cursed is he who sleeps with his father’s wife, for he has violated his father’s marriage bed.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’ 
05027021	‘Cursed is he who lies with any animal.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’ 
05027022	‘Cursed is he who sleeps with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’ 
05027023	‘Cursed is he who sleeps with his mother-in-law.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’ 
05027024	‘Cursed is he who strikes down his neighbor in secret.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’ 
05027025	‘Cursed is he who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’ 
05027026	‘Cursed is he who does not put the words of this law into practice.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’ 
05028001	“Now if you faithfully obey the voice of the LORD your God and are careful to follow all His commandments I am giving you today, the LORD your God will set you high above all the nations of the earth. 
05028002	And all these blessings will come upon you and overtake you, if you will obey the voice of the LORD your God: 
05028003	You will be blessed in the city and blessed in the country. 
05028004	The fruit of your womb will be blessed, as well as the produce of your land and the offspring of your livestock— the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks. 
05028005	Your basket and kneading bowl will be blessed. 
05028006	You will be blessed when you come in and blessed when you go out. 
05028007	The LORD will cause the enemies who rise up against you to be defeated before you. They will march out against you in one direction but flee from you in seven. 
05028008	The LORD will decree a blessing on your barns and on everything to which you put your hand; the LORD your God will bless you in the land He is giving you. 
05028009	The LORD will establish you as His holy people, just as He has sworn to you, if you keep the commandments of the LORD your God and walk in His ways. 
05028010	Then all the peoples of the earth will see that you are called by the name of the LORD, and they will stand in awe of you. 
05028011	The LORD will make you prosper abundantly—in the fruit of your womb, the offspring of your livestock, and the produce of your land—in the land that the LORD swore to your fathers to give you. 
05028012	The LORD will open the heavens, His abundant storehouse, to send rain on your land in season and to bless all the work of your hands. You will lend to many nations, but borrow from none. 
05028013	The LORD will make you the head and not the tail; you will only move upward and never downward, if you hear and carefully follow the commandments of the LORD your God, which I am giving you today. 
05028014	Do not turn aside to the right or to the left from any of the words I command you today, and do not go after other gods to serve them. 
05028015	If, however, you do not obey the LORD your God by carefully following all His commandments and statutes I am giving you today, all these curses will come upon you and overtake you: 
05028016	You will be cursed in the city and cursed in the country. 
05028017	Your basket and kneading bowl will be cursed. 
05028018	The fruit of your womb will be cursed, as well as the produce of your land, the calves of your herds, and the lambs of your flocks. 
05028019	You will be cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out. 
05028020	The LORD will send curses upon you, confusion and reproof in all to which you put your hand, until you are destroyed and quickly perish because of the wickedness you have committed in forsaking Him. 
05028021	The LORD will make the plague cling to you until He has exterminated you from the land that you are entering to possess. 
05028022	The LORD will strike you with wasting disease, with fever and inflammation, with scorching heat and drought, and with blight and mildew; these will pursue you until you perish. 
05028023	The sky over your head will be bronze, and the earth beneath you iron. 
05028024	The LORD will turn the rain of your land into dust and powder; it will descend on you from the sky until you are destroyed. 
05028025	The LORD will cause you to be defeated before your enemies. You will march out against them in one direction but flee from them in seven. You will be an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth. 
05028026	Your corpses will be food for all the birds of the air and beasts of the earth, with no one to scare them away. 
05028027	The LORD will afflict you with the boils of Egypt, with tumors and scabs and itch from which you cannot be cured. 
05028028	The LORD will afflict you with madness, blindness, and confusion of mind, 
05028029	and at noon you will grope about like a blind man in the darkness. You will not prosper in your ways. Day after day you will be oppressed and plundered, with no one to save you. 
05028030	You will be pledged in marriage to a woman, but another man will violate her. You will build a house but will not live in it. You will plant a vineyard but will not enjoy its fruit. 
05028031	Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will not eat any of it. Your donkey will be taken away and not returned to you. Your flock will be given to your enemies, and no one will save you. 
05028032	Your sons and daughters will be given to another nation, while your eyes grow weary looking for them day after day, with no power in your hand. 
05028033	A people you do not know will eat the produce of your land and of all your toil. All your days you will be oppressed and crushed. 
05028034	You will be driven mad by the sights you see. 
05028035	The LORD will afflict you with painful, incurable boils on your knees and thighs, from the soles of your feet to the top of your head. 
05028036	The LORD will bring you and the king you appoint to a nation neither you nor your fathers have known, and there you will worship other gods—gods of wood and stone. 
05028037	You will become an object of horror, scorn, and ridicule among all the nations to which the LORD will drive you. 
05028038	You will sow much seed in the field but harvest little, because the locusts will consume it. 
05028039	You will plant and cultivate vineyards, but will neither drink the wine nor gather the grapes, because worms will eat them. 
05028040	You will have olive trees throughout your territory but will never anoint yourself with oil, because the olives will drop off. 
05028041	You will father sons and daughters, but they will not remain yours, because they will go into captivity. 
05028042	Swarms of locusts will consume all your trees and the produce of your land. 
05028043	The foreigner living among you will rise higher and higher above you, while you sink down lower and lower. 
05028044	He will lend to you, but you will not lend to him. He will be the head, and you will be the tail. 
05028045	All these curses will come upon you. They will pursue you and overtake you until you are destroyed, since you did not obey the LORD your God and keep the commandments and statutes He gave you. 
05028046	These curses will be a sign and a wonder upon you and your descendants forever. 
05028047	Because you did not serve the LORD your God with joy and gladness of heart in all your abundance, 
05028048	you will serve your enemies the LORD will send against you in famine, thirst, nakedness, and destitution. He will place an iron yoke on your neck until He has destroyed you. 
05028049	The LORD will bring a nation from afar, from the ends of the earth, to swoop down upon you like an eagle—a nation whose language you will not understand, 
05028050	a ruthless nation with no respect for the old and no pity for the young. 
05028051	They will eat the offspring of your livestock and the produce of your land until you are destroyed. They will leave you no grain or new wine or oil, no calves of your herds or lambs of your flocks, until they have caused you to perish. 
05028052	They will besiege all the cities throughout your land, until the high and fortified walls in which you trust have fallen. They will besiege all your cities throughout the land that the LORD your God has given you. 
05028053	Then you will eat the fruit of your womb, the flesh of the sons and daughters whom the LORD your God has given you, in the siege and distress that your enemy will inflict on you. 
05028054	The most gentle and refined man among you will begrudge his brother, the wife he embraces, and the rest of his children who have survived, 
05028055	refusing to share with any of them the flesh of his children he will eat because he has nothing left in the siege and distress that your enemy will inflict on you within all your gates. 
05028056	The most gentle and refined woman among you, so gentle and refined she would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground, will begrudge the husband she embraces and her son and daughter 
05028057	the afterbirth that comes from between her legs and the children she bears, because she will secretly eat them for lack of anything else in the siege and distress that your enemy will inflict on you within your gates. 
05028058	If you are not careful to observe all the words of this law which are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and awesome name—the LORD your God— 
05028059	He will bring upon you and your descendants extraordinary disasters, severe and lasting plagues, and terrible and chronic sicknesses. 
05028060	He will afflict you again with all the diseases you dreaded in Egypt, and they will cling to you. 
05028061	The LORD will also bring upon you every sickness and plague not recorded in this Book of the Law, until you are destroyed. 
05028062	You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left few in number, because you would not obey the voice of the LORD your God. 
05028063	Just as it pleased the LORD to make you prosper and multiply, so also it will please Him to annihilate you and destroy you. And you will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. 
05028064	Then the LORD will scatter you among all the nations, from one end of the earth to the other, and there you will worship other gods, gods of wood and stone, which neither you nor your fathers have known. 
05028065	Among those nations you will find no repose, not even a resting place for the sole of your foot. There the LORD will give you a trembling heart, failing eyes, and a despairing soul. 
05028066	So your life will hang in doubt before you, and you will be afraid night and day, never certain of survival. 
05028067	In the morning you will say, ‘If only it were evening!’ and in the evening you will say, ‘If only it were morning!’—because of the dread in your hearts of the terrifying sights you will see. 
05028068	The LORD will return you to Egypt in ships by a route that I said you should never see again. There you will sell yourselves to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you.” 
05029001	These are the words of the covenant that the LORD commanded Moses to make with the Israelites in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant He had made with them at Horeb. 
05029002	Moses summoned all Israel and proclaimed to them, “You have seen with your own eyes everything the LORD did in Egypt to Pharaoh, to all his officials, and to all his land. 
05029003	You saw with your own eyes the great trials, and those miraculous signs and wonders. 
05029004	Yet to this day the LORD has not given you a mind to understand, eyes to see, or ears to hear. 
05029005	For forty years I led you in the wilderness, yet your clothes and sandals did not wear out. 
05029006	You ate no bread and drank no wine or strong drink, so that you might know that I am the LORD your God. 
05029007	When you reached this place, Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out against us in battle, but we defeated them. 
05029008	We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. 
05029009	So keep and follow the words of this covenant, that you may prosper in all you do. 
05029010	All of you are standing today before the LORD your God—you leaders of tribes, elders, officials, and all the men of Israel, 
05029011	your children and wives, and the foreigners in your camps who cut your wood and draw your water— 
05029012	so that you may enter into the covenant of the LORD your God, which He is making with you today, and into His oath, 
05029013	and so that He may establish you today as His people, and He may be your God as He promised you and as He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
05029014	I am making this covenant and this oath not only with you, 
05029015	but also with those who are standing here with us today in the presence of the LORD our God, as well as with those who are not here today. 
05029016	For you yourselves know how we lived in the land of Egypt and how we passed through the nations on the way here. 
05029017	You saw the abominations and idols among them made of wood and stone, of silver and gold. 
05029018	Make sure there is no man or woman, clan or tribe among you today whose heart turns away from the LORD our God to go and worship the gods of those nations. Make sure there is no root among you that bears such poisonous and bitter fruit, 
05029019	because when such a person hears the words of this oath, he invokes a blessing on himself, saying, ‘I will have peace, even though I walk in the stubbornness of my own heart.’ This will bring disaster on the watered land as well as the dry. 
05029020	The LORD will never be willing to forgive him. Instead, His anger and jealousy will burn against that man, and every curse written in this book will fall upon him. The LORD will blot out his name from under heaven 
05029021	and single him out from all the tribes of Israel for disaster, according to all the curses of the covenant written in this Book of the Law. 
05029022	Then the generation to come—your sons who follow you and the foreigner who comes from a distant land—will see the plagues of the land and the sicknesses the LORD has inflicted on it. 
05029023	All its soil will be a burning waste of sulfur and salt, unsown and unproductive, with no plant growing on it, just like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the LORD overthrew in His fierce anger. 
05029024	So all the nations will ask, ‘Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land? Why this great outburst of anger?’ 
05029025	And the people will answer, ‘It is because they abandoned the covenant of the LORD, the God of their fathers, which He made with them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt. 
05029026	They went and served other gods, and they worshiped gods they had not known—gods that the LORD had not given to them. 
05029027	Therefore the anger of the LORD burned against this land, and He brought upon it every curse written in this book. 
05029028	The LORD uprooted them from their land in His anger, rage, and great wrath, and He cast them into another land, where they are today.’ 
05029029	The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, so that we may follow all the words of this law. 
05030001	“When all these things come upon you—the blessings and curses I have set before you—and you call them to mind in all the nations to which the LORD your God has banished you, 
05030002	and when you and your children return to the LORD your God and obey His voice with all your heart and all your soul according to everything I am giving you today, 
05030003	then He will restore you from captivity and have compassion on you and gather you from all the nations to which the LORD your God has scattered you. 
05030004	Even if you have been banished to the farthest horizon, He will gather you and return you from there. 
05030005	And the LORD your God will bring you into the land your fathers possessed, and you will take possession of it. He will cause you to prosper and multiply more than your fathers. 
05030006	The LORD your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants, and you will love Him with all your heart and with all your soul, so that you may live. 
05030007	Then the LORD your God will put all these curses upon your enemies who hate you and persecute you. 
05030008	And you will again obey the voice of the LORD and follow all His commandments I am giving you today. 
05030009	So the LORD your God will make you abound in all the work of your hands and in the fruit of your womb, the offspring of your livestock, and the produce of your land. Indeed, the LORD will again delight in your prosperity, as He delighted in that of your fathers, 
05030010	if you obey the LORD your God by keeping His commandments and statutes that are written in this Book of the Law, and if you turn to Him with all your heart and with all your soul. 
05030011	For this commandment I give you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach. 
05030012	It is not in heaven, that you should need to ask, ‘Who will ascend into heaven to get it for us and proclaim it, that we may obey it?’ 
05030013	And it is not beyond the sea, that you should need to ask, ‘Who will cross the sea to get it for us and proclaim it, that we may obey it?’ 
05030014	But the word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart, so that you may obey it. 
05030015	See, I have set before you today life and prosperity, as well as death and disaster. 
05030016	For I am commanding you today to love the LORD your God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commandments, statutes, and ordinances, so that you may live and increase, and the LORD your God may bless you in the land that you are entering to possess. 
05030017	But if your heart turns away and you do not listen, but are drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship them, 
05030018	I declare to you today that you will surely perish; you shall not prolong your days in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess. 
05030019	I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing. Therefore choose life, so that you and your descendants may live, 
05030020	and that you may love the LORD your God, obey Him, and hold fast to Him. For He is your life, and He will prolong your life in the land that the LORD swore to give to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” 
05031001	When Moses had finished speaking these words to all Israel, 
05031002	he said to them, “I am now a hundred and twenty years old; I am no longer able to come and go, and the LORD has said to me, ‘You shall not cross the Jordan.’ 
05031003	The LORD your God Himself will cross over ahead of you. He will destroy these nations before you, and you will dispossess them. Joshua will cross ahead of you, as the LORD has said. 
05031004	And the LORD will do to them as He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, when He destroyed them along with their land. 
05031005	The LORD will deliver them over to you, and you must do to them exactly as I have commanded you. 
05031006	Be strong and courageous; do not be afraid or terrified of them, for it is the LORD your God who goes with you; He will never leave you nor forsake you.” 
05031007	Then Moses called for Joshua and said to him in the presence of all Israel, “Be strong and courageous, for you will go with this people into the land that the LORD swore to their fathers to give them, and you shall give it to them as an inheritance. 
05031008	The LORD Himself goes before you; He will be with you. He will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid or discouraged.” 
05031009	So Moses wrote down this law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel. 
05031010	Then Moses commanded them, “At the end of every seven years, at the appointed time in the year of remission of debt, during the Feast of Tabernacles, 
05031011	when all Israel comes before the LORD your God at the place He will choose, you are to read this law in the hearing of all Israel. 
05031012	Assemble the people—men, women, children, and the foreigners within your gates—so that they may listen and learn to fear the LORD your God and to follow carefully all the words of this law. 
05031013	Then their children who do not know the law will listen and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as you live in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.” 
05031014	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Behold, the time of your death is near. Call Joshua and present yourselves at the Tent of Meeting, so that I may commission him.” So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the Tent of Meeting. 
05031015	Then the LORD appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the cloud stood over the entrance to the tent. 
05031016	And the LORD said to Moses, “You will soon rest with your fathers, and these people will rise up and prostitute themselves with the foreign gods of the land they are entering. They will forsake Me and break the covenant I have made with them. 
05031017	On that day My anger will burn against them, and I will abandon them and hide My face from them, so that they will be consumed, and many troubles and afflictions will befall them. On that day they will say, ‘Have not these disasters come upon us because our God is no longer with us?’ 
05031018	And on that day I will surely hide My face because of all the evil they have done by turning to other gods. 
05031019	Now therefore, write down for yourselves this song and teach it to the Israelites; have them recite it, so that it may be a witness for Me against them. 
05031020	When I have brought them into the land that I swore to give their fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey, they will eat their fill and prosper. Then they will turn to other gods and worship them, and they will reject Me and break My covenant. 
05031021	And when many troubles and afflictions have come upon them, this song will testify against them, because it will not be forgotten from the lips of their descendants. For I know their inclination, even before I bring them into the land that I swore to give them.” 
05031022	So that very day Moses wrote down this song and taught it to the Israelites. 
05031023	Then the LORD commissioned Joshua son of Nun and said, “Be strong and courageous, for you will bring the Israelites into the land that I swore to give them, and I will be with you.” 
05031024	When Moses had finished writing in a book the words of this law from beginning to end, 
05031025	he gave this command to the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD: 
05031026	“Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, so that it may remain there as a witness against you. 
05031027	For I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are. If you are already rebelling against the LORD while I am still alive, how much more will you rebel after my death! 
05031028	Assemble before me all the elders of your tribes and all your officers so that I may speak these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to witness against them. 
05031029	For I know that after my death you will become utterly corrupt and turn from the path I have commanded you. And in the days to come, disaster will befall you because you will do evil in the sight of the LORD to provoke Him to anger by the work of your hands.” 
05031030	Then Moses recited aloud to the whole assembly of Israel the words of this song from beginning to end: 
05032001	Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak; hear, O earth, the words of my mouth. 
05032002	Let my teaching fall like rain and my speech settle like dew, like gentle rain on new grass, like showers on tender plants. 
05032003	For I will proclaim the name of the LORD. Ascribe greatness to our God! 
05032004	He is the Rock, His work is perfect; all His ways are just. A God of faithfulness without injustice, righteous and upright is He. 
05032005	His people have acted corruptly toward Him; the blemish on them is not that of His children, but of a perverse and crooked generation. 
05032006	Is this how you repay the LORD, O foolish and senseless people? Is He not your Father and Creator? Has He not made you and established you? 
05032007	Remember the days of old; consider the years long past. Ask your father, and he will tell you, your elders, and they will inform you. 
05032008	When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, when He divided the sons of man, He set the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the sons of God. 
05032009	But the LORD’s portion is His people, Jacob His allotted inheritance. 
05032010	He found him in a desert land, in a barren, howling wilderness; He surrounded him, He instructed him, He guarded him as the apple of His eye. 
05032011	As an eagle stirs up its nest and hovers over its young, He spread His wings to catch them and carried them on His pinions. 
05032012	The LORD alone led him, and no foreign god was with him. 
05032013	He made him ride on the heights of the land and fed him the produce of the field. He nourished him with honey from the rock and oil from the flinty crag, 
05032014	with curds from the herd and milk from the flock, with the fat of lambs, with rams from Bashan, and goats, with the choicest grains of wheat. From the juice of the finest grapes you drank the wine. 
05032015	But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked— becoming fat, bloated, and gorged. He abandoned the God who made him and scorned the Rock of his salvation. 
05032016	They provoked His jealousy with foreign gods; they enraged Him with abominations. 
05032017	They sacrificed to demons, not to God, to gods they had not known, to newly arrived gods, which your fathers did not fear. 
05032018	You ignored the Rock who brought you forth; you forgot the God who gave you birth. 
05032019	When the LORD saw this, He rejected them, provoked to anger by His sons and daughters. 
05032020	He said: “I will hide My face from them; I will see what will be their end. For they are a perverse generation— children of unfaithfulness. 
05032021	They have provoked My jealousy by that which is not God; they have enraged Me with their worthless idols. So I will make them jealous by those who are not a people; I will make them angry by a nation without understanding. 
05032022	For a fire has been kindled by My anger, and it burns to the depths of Sheol; it consumes the earth and its produce, and scorches the foundations of the mountains. 
05032023	I will heap disasters upon them; I will spend My arrows against them. 
05032024	They will be wasted from hunger and ravaged by pestilence and bitter plague; I will send the fangs of wild beasts against them, with the venom of vipers that slither in the dust. 
05032025	Outside, the sword will take their children, and inside, terror will strike the young man and the young woman, the infant and the gray-haired man. 
05032026	I would have said that I would cut them to pieces and blot out their memory from mankind, 
05032027	if I had not dreaded the taunt of the enemy, lest their adversaries misunderstand and say: ‘Our own hand has prevailed; it was not the LORD who did all this.’” 
05032028	Israel is a nation devoid of counsel, with no understanding among them. 
05032029	If only they were wise, they would understand it; they would comprehend their fate. 
05032030	How could one man pursue a thousand, or two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, unless the LORD had given them up? 
05032031	For their rock is not like our Rock, even our enemies concede. 
05032032	But their vine is from the vine of Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are poisonous; their clusters are bitter. 
05032033	Their wine is the venom of serpents, the deadly poison of cobras. 
05032034	“Have I not stored up these things, sealed up within My vaults? 
05032035	Vengeance is Mine; I will repay. In due time their foot will slip; for their day of disaster is near, and their doom is coming quickly.” 
05032036	For the LORD will vindicate His people and have compassion on His servants when He sees that their strength is gone and no one remains, slave or free. 
05032037	He will say: “Where are their gods, the rock in which they took refuge, 
05032038	which ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings? Let them rise up and help you; let them give you shelter! 
05032039	See now that I am He; there is no God besides Me. I bring death and I give life; I wound and I heal, and there is no one who can deliver from My hand. 
05032040	For I lift up My hand to heaven and declare: As surely as I live forever, 
05032041	when I sharpen My flashing sword, and My hand grasps it in judgment, I will take vengeance on My adversaries and repay those who hate Me. 
05032042	I will make My arrows drunk with blood, while My sword devours flesh— the blood of the slain and captives, the heads of the enemy leaders.” 
05032043	Rejoice, O heavens, with Him, and let all God’s angels worship Him. Rejoice, O nations, with His people; for He will avenge the blood of His children. He will take vengeance on His adversaries and repay those who hate Him; He will cleanse His land and His people. 
05032044	Then Moses came with Joshua son of Nun and recited all the words of this song in the hearing of the people. 
05032045	When Moses had finished reciting all these words to all Israel, 
05032046	he said to them, “Take to heart all the words I have solemnly declared to you this day, so that you may command your children to carefully follow all the words of this law. 
05032047	For they are not idle words to you, because they are your life, and by them you will live long in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.” 
05032048	On that same day the LORD said to Moses, 
05032049	“Go up into the Abarim Range to Mount Nebo, in the land of Moab across from Jericho, and view the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites as their own possession. 
05032050	And there on the mountain that you climb, you will die and be gathered to your people, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people. 
05032051	For at the waters of Meribah-kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin, both of you broke faith with Me among the Israelites by failing to treat Me as holy in their presence. 
05032052	Although you shall see from a distance the land that I am giving the Israelites, you shall not enter it.” 
05033001	This is the blessing that Moses the man of God pronounced upon the Israelites before his death. 
05033002	He said: “The LORD came from Sinai and dawned upon us from Seir; He shone forth from Mount Paran and came with myriads of holy ones, with flaming fire at His right hand. 
05033003	Surely You love the people; all the holy ones are in Your hand, and they sit down at Your feet; each receives Your words— 
05033004	the law that Moses gave us, the possession of the assembly of Jacob. 
05033005	So the LORD became King in Jeshurun when the leaders of the people gathered, when the tribes of Israel came together. 
05033006	Let Reuben live and not die, nor his men be few.” 
05033007	And concerning Judah he said: “O LORD, hear the cry of Judah and bring him to his people. With his own hands he defends his cause, but may You be a help against his foes.” 
05033008	Concerning Levi he said: “Give Your Thummim to Levi and Your Urim to Your godly one, whom You tested at Massah and contested at the waters of Meribah. 
05033009	He said of his father and mother, ‘I do not consider them.’ He disregarded his brothers and did not know his own sons, for he kept Your word and maintained Your covenant. 
05033010	He will teach Your ordinances to Jacob and Your law to Israel; he will set incense before You and whole burnt offerings on Your altar. 
05033011	Bless his substance, O LORD, and accept the work of his hands. Smash the loins of those who rise against him, and of his foes so they can rise no more.” 
05033012	Concerning Benjamin he said: “May the beloved of the LORD rest secure in Him; God shields him all day long, and upon His shoulders he rests.” 
05033013	Concerning Joseph he said: “May his land be blessed by the LORD with the precious dew from heaven above and the deep waters that lie beneath, 
05033014	with the bountiful harvest from the sun and the abundant yield of the seasons, 
05033015	with the best of the ancient mountains and the bounty of the everlasting hills, 
05033016	with the choice gifts of the land and everything in it, and with the favor of Him who dwelt in the burning bush. May these rest on the head of Joseph and crown the brow of the prince of his brothers. 
05033017	His majesty is like a firstborn bull, and his horns are like those of a wild ox. With them he will gore the nations, even to the ends of the earth. Such are the myriads of Ephraim, and such are the thousands of Manasseh.” 
05033018	Concerning Zebulun he said: “Rejoice, Zebulun, in your journeys, and Issachar, in your tents. 
05033019	They will call the peoples to a mountain; there they will offer sacrifices of righteousness. For they will feast on the abundance of the seas and the hidden treasures of the sand.” 
05033020	Concerning Gad he said: “Blessed is he who enlarges the domain of Gad! He lies down like a lion and tears off an arm or a head. 
05033021	He chose the best land for himself, because a ruler’s portion was reserved for him there. He came with the leaders of the people; he administered the LORD’s justice and His ordinances for Israel.” 
05033022	Concerning Dan he said: “Dan is a lion’s cub, leaping out of Bashan.” 
05033023	Concerning Naphtali he said: “Naphtali is abounding with favor, full of the blessing of the LORD; he shall take possession of the sea and the south.” 
05033024	And concerning Asher he said: “May Asher be the most blessed of sons; may he be the most favored among his brothers and dip his foot in oil. 
05033025	May the bolts of your gate be iron and bronze, and may your strength match your days.” 
05033026	“There is none like the God of Jeshurun, who rides the heavens to your aid, and the clouds in His majesty. 
05033027	The eternal God is your dwelling place, and underneath are the everlasting arms. He drives out the enemy before you, giving the command, ‘Destroy him!’ 
05033028	So Israel dwells securely; the fountain of Jacob lives untroubled in a land of grain and new wine, where even the heavens drip with dew. 
05033029	Blessed are you, O Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the LORD? He is the shield that protects you, the sword in which you boast. Your enemies will cower before you, and you shall trample their high places.” 
05034001	Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which faces Jericho. And the LORD showed him the whole land—from Gilead as far as Dan, 
05034002	all of Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Western Sea, 
05034003	the Negev, and the region from the Valley of Jericho (the City of Palms) all the way to Zoar. 
05034004	And the LORD said to him, “This is the land that I swore to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob when I said, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I have let you see it with your own eyes, but you will not cross into it.” 
05034005	So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, as the LORD had said. 
05034006	And He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab facing Beth-peor, and no one to this day knows the location of his grave. 
05034007	Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, yet his eyes were not weak, and his vitality had not diminished. 
05034008	The Israelites grieved for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, until the time of weeping and mourning for Moses came to an end. 
05034009	Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him. So the Israelites obeyed him and did as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
05034010	Since that time, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face— 
05034011	no prophet who did all the signs and wonders that the LORD sent Moses to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and to all his officials and all his land, 
05034012	and no prophet who performed all the mighty acts of power and awesome deeds that Moses did in the sight of all Israel. 
06001001	Now after the death of His servant Moses, the LORD spoke to Joshua son of Nun, Moses’ assistant, saying, 
06001002	“Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore arise, you and all these people, and cross over the Jordan into the land that I am giving to the children of Israel. 
06001003	I have given you every place where the sole of your foot will tread, just as I promised to Moses. 
06001004	Your territory shall extend from the wilderness and Lebanon to the great River Euphrates—all the land of the Hittites—and west as far as the Great Sea. 
06001005	No one shall stand against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so will I be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you. 
06001006	Be strong and courageous, for you shall give these people the inheritance of the land that I swore to their fathers I would give them. 
06001007	Above all, be strong and very courageous. Be careful to observe all the law that My servant Moses commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may prosper wherever you go. 
06001008	This Book of the Law must not depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. For then you will prosper and succeed in all you do. 
06001009	Have I not commanded you to be strong and courageous? Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.” 
06001010	Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people: 
06001011	“Go through the camp and tell the people, ‘Prepare your provisions, for within three days you will cross the Jordan to go in and take possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess.’” 
06001012	But to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said, 
06001013	“Remember what Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you when he said, ‘The LORD your God will give you rest, and He will give you this land.’ 
06001014	Your wives, your young children, and your livestock may remain in the land that Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan. But all your mighty men of valor must be armed for battle to cross over ahead of your brothers and help them, 
06001015	until the LORD gives them rest as He has done for you, and your brothers also possess the land that the LORD your God is giving them. Then you may return to the land of your inheritance and take possession of that which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the east side of the Jordan.” 
06001016	So they answered Joshua, “Everything you have commanded us we will do, and everywhere you send us we will go. 
06001017	Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you. And may the LORD your God be with you, as He was with Moses. 
06001018	Anyone who rebels against your order and does not obey your words, all that you command him, will be put to death. Above all, be strong and courageous!” 
06002001	Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two spies from Shittim, saying, “Go, inspect the land, especially Jericho.” So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there. 
06002002	And it was reported to the king of Jericho: “Behold, some men of Israel have come here tonight to spy out the land.” 
06002003	So the king of Jericho sent to Rahab and said, “Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, for they have come to spy out the whole land.” 
06002004	But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. So she said, “Yes, the men did come to me, but I did not know where they had come from. 
06002005	At dusk, when the gate was about to close, the men went out, and I do not know which way they went. Pursue them quickly, and you may catch them!” 
06002006	(But Rahab had taken them up to the roof and hidden them among the stalks of flax that she had laid out there.) 
06002007	So the king’s men set out in pursuit of the spies along the road to the fords of the Jordan, and as soon as they had gone out, the gate was shut. 
06002008	Before the spies lay down for the night, Rahab went up on the roof 
06002009	and said to them, “I know that the LORD has given you this land and that the fear of you has fallen on us, so that all who dwell in the land are melting in fear of you. 
06002010	For we have heard how the LORD dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites across the Jordan, whom you devoted to destruction. 
06002011	When we heard this, our hearts melted and everyone’s courage failed because of you, for the LORD your God is God in the heavens above and on the earth below. 
06002012	Now therefore, please swear to me by the LORD that you will indeed show kindness to my family, because I showed kindness to you. Give me a sure sign 
06002013	that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and that you will deliver us from death.” 
06002014	“Our lives for your lives!” the men agreed. “If you do not report our mission, we will show you kindness and faithfulness when the LORD gives us the land.” 
06002015	Then Rahab let them down by a rope through the window, since the house where she lived was built into the wall of the city. 
06002016	“Go to the hill country,” she said, “so that your pursuers will not find you. Hide yourselves there for three days until they have returned; then go on your way.” 
06002017	The men said to her, “We will not be bound by this oath you made us swear 
06002018	unless, when we enter the land, you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and unless you have brought your father and mother and brothers and all your family into your house. 
06002019	If anyone goes out the door of your house into the street, his blood will be on his own head, and we will be innocent. But if a hand is laid on anyone with you in the house, his blood will be on our heads. 
06002020	And if you report our mission, we will be released from the oath you made us swear.” 
06002021	“Let it be as you say,” she replied, and she sent them away. And when they had gone, she tied the scarlet cord in the window. 
06002022	So the spies went out into the hill country and stayed there three days, until their pursuers had returned without finding them, having searched all along the road. 
06002023	Then the two men started back, came down from the hill country, and crossed the river. So they came to Joshua son of Nun and reported all that had happened to them. 
06002024	“The LORD has surely delivered the entire land into our hands,” they said to Joshua. “Indeed, all who dwell in the land are melting in fear of us.” 
06003001	Early the next morning Joshua got up and left Shittim with all the Israelites. They went as far as the Jordan, where they camped before crossing over. 
06003002	After three days the officers went through the camp 
06003003	and commanded the people: “When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God being carried by the Levitical priests, you are to set out from your positions and follow it. 
06003004	But keep a distance of about two thousand cubits between yourselves and the ark. Do not go near it, so that you can see the way to go, since you have never traveled this way before.” 
06003005	Then Joshua told the people, “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you.” 
06003006	And he said to the priests, “Take the ark of the covenant and go on ahead of the people.” So they carried the ark of the covenant and went ahead of them. 
06003007	Now the LORD said to Joshua, “Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so they may know that I am with you just as I was with Moses. 
06003008	Command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant: ‘When you reach the edge of the waters, stand in the Jordan.’” 
06003009	So Joshua told the Israelites, “Come here and listen to the words of the LORD your God.” 
06003010	He continued, “This is how you will know that the living God is among you and that He will surely drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites. 
06003011	Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go ahead of you into the Jordan. 
06003012	Now choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe. 
06003013	When the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the LORD—the Lord of all the earth—touch down in the waters of the Jordan, its flowing waters will be cut off and will stand up in a heap.” 
06003014	So when the people broke camp to cross the Jordan, the priests carried the ark of the covenant ahead of them. 
06003015	Now the Jordan overflows its banks throughout the harvest season. But as soon as the priests carrying the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the water’s edge, 
06003016	the flowing water stood still. It backed up as far upstream as Adam, a city in the area of Zarethan, while the water flowing toward the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea ) was completely cut off. So the people crossed over opposite Jericho. 
06003017	The priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, while all Israel crossed over the dry ground, until the entire nation had crossed the Jordan. 
06004001	When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the LORD said to Joshua, 
06004002	“Choose twelve men from among the people, one from each tribe, 
06004003	and command them: ‘Take up for yourselves twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan where the priests were standing, carry them with you, and set them down in the place where you spend the night.’” 
06004004	So Joshua summoned the twelve men he had appointed from the Israelites, one from each tribe, 
06004005	and said to them, “Cross over before the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan. Each of you is to take a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of Israel, 
06004006	to serve as a sign among you. In the future, when your children ask, ‘What do these stones mean to you?’ 
06004007	you are to tell them, ‘The waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD. When it crossed the Jordan, the waters were cut off.’ Therefore these stones will be a memorial to the Israelites forever.” 
06004008	Thus the Israelites did as Joshua had commanded them. They took up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, one for each tribe of Israel, just as the LORD had told Joshua; and they carried them to the camp, where they set them down. 
06004009	Joshua also set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, in the place where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant stood. And the stones are there to this day. 
06004010	Now the priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until the people had completed everything the LORD had commanded Joshua to tell them, just as Moses had directed Joshua. The people hurried across, 
06004011	and after everyone had finished crossing, the priests with the ark of the LORD crossed in the sight of the people. 
06004012	The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over before the Israelites, armed for battle as Moses had instructed them. 
06004013	About 40,000 troops armed for battle crossed over before the LORD into the plains of Jericho. 
06004014	On that day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they revered him all the days of his life, just as they had revered Moses. 
06004015	Then the LORD said to Joshua, 
06004016	“Command the priests who carry the ark of the Testimony to come up from the Jordan.” 
06004017	So Joshua commanded the priests, “Come up from the Jordan.” 
06004018	When the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD came up out of the Jordan and their feet touched the dry land, the waters of the Jordan returned to their course and overflowed all the banks as before. 
06004019	On the tenth day of the first month the people went up from the Jordan and camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho. 
06004020	And there at Gilgal Joshua set up the twelve stones they had taken from the Jordan. 
06004021	Then Joshua said to the Israelites, “In the future, when your children ask their fathers, ‘What is the meaning of these stones?’ 
06004022	you are to tell them, ‘Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.’ 
06004023	For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over, just as He did to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed over. 
06004024	He did this so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the LORD is mighty, and so that you may always fear the LORD your God.” 
06005001	Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the coast heard how the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the Israelites until they had crossed over, their hearts melted and their spirits failed for fear of the Israelites. 
06005002	At that time the LORD said to Joshua, “Make flint knives and circumcise the sons of Israel once again.” 
06005003	So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth. 
06005004	Now this is why Joshua circumcised them: All those who came out of Egypt—all the men of war—had died on the journey in the wilderness after they had left Egypt. 
06005005	Though all who had come out were circumcised, none of those born in the wilderness on the journey from Egypt had been circumcised. 
06005006	For the Israelites had wandered in the wilderness forty years, until all the nation’s men of war who had come out of Egypt had died, since they did not obey the LORD. So the LORD vowed never to let them see the land He had sworn to their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
06005007	And He raised up their sons in their place, and these were the ones Joshua circumcised. Until this time they were still uncircumcised, since they had not been circumcised along the way. 
06005008	And after all the nation had been circumcised, they stayed there in the camp until they were healed. 
06005009	Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.” So that place has been called Gilgal to this day. 
06005010	On the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, while the Israelites were camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, they kept the Passover. 
06005011	The day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate unleavened bread and roasted grain from the produce of the land. 
06005012	And the day after they had eaten from the produce of the land, the manna ceased. There was no more manna for the Israelites, so that year they began to eat the crops of the land of Canaan. 
06005013	Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in His hand. Joshua approached Him and asked, “Are You for us or for our enemies?” 
06005014	“Neither,” He replied. “I have now come as Commander of the LORD’s army.” Then Joshua fell facedown in reverence and asked Him, “What does my Lord have to say to His servant?” 
06005015	The Commander of the LORD’s army replied, “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy.” And Joshua did so. 
06006001	Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the Israelites. No one went out and no one came in. 
06006002	And the LORD said to Joshua, “Behold, I have delivered Jericho into your hand, along with its king and its mighty men of valor. 
06006003	March around the city with all the men of war, circling the city one time. Do this for six days. 
06006004	Have seven priests carry seven rams’ horns in front of the ark. Then on the seventh day, march around the city seven times, while the priests blow the horns. 
06006005	And when there is a long blast of the ram’s horn and you hear its sound, have all the people give a mighty shout. Then the wall of the city will collapse and all your people will charge straight into the city.” 
06006006	So Joshua son of Nun summoned the priests and said, “Take up the ark of the covenant and have seven priests carry seven rams’ horns in front of the ark of the LORD.” 
06006007	And he told the people, “Advance and march around the city, with the armed troops going ahead of the ark of the LORD.” 
06006008	After Joshua had spoken to the people, seven priests carrying seven rams’ horns before the LORD advanced and blew the horns, and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them. 
06006009	While the horns continued to sound, the armed troops marched ahead of the priests who blew the horns, and the rear guard followed the ark. 
06006010	But Joshua had commanded the people: “Do not give a battle cry or let your voice be heard; do not let one word come out of your mouth until the day I tell you to shout. Then you are to shout!” 
06006011	So he had the ark of the LORD carried around the city, circling it once. And the people returned to the camp and spent the night there. 
06006012	Joshua got up early the next morning, and the priests took the ark of the LORD. 
06006013	And the seven priests carrying seven rams’ horns kept marching ahead of the ark of the LORD and blowing the horns. The armed troops went in front of them and the rear guard followed the ark of the LORD, while the horns kept sounding. 
06006014	So on the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six days. 
06006015	Then on the seventh day, they got up at dawn and marched around the city seven times in the same manner. That was the only day they circled the city seven times. 
06006016	After the seventh time around, the priests blew the horns, and Joshua commanded the people, “Shout! For the LORD has given you the city! 
06006017	Now the city and everything in it must be devoted to the LORD for destruction. Only Rahab the prostitute and all those with her in her house will live, because she hid the spies we sent. 
06006018	But keep away from the things devoted to destruction, lest you yourself be set apart for destruction. If you take any of these, you will set apart the camp of Israel for destruction and bring disaster upon it. 
06006019	For all the silver and gold and all the articles of bronze and iron are holy to the LORD; they must go into His treasury.” 
06006020	So when the rams’ horns sounded, the people shouted. When they heard the blast of the horn, the people gave a great shout, and the wall collapsed. Then all the people charged straight into the city and captured it. 
06006021	With the edge of the sword they devoted to destruction everything in the city—man and woman, young and old, oxen, sheep, and donkeys. 
06006022	Meanwhile, Joshua told the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the house of the prostitute and bring out the woman and all who are with her, just as you promised her.” 
06006023	So the young spies went in and brought out Rahab, her father and mother and brothers, and all who belonged to her. They brought out her whole family and settled them outside the camp of Israel. 
06006024	Then the Israelites burned up the city and everything in it. However, they put the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the LORD’s house. 
06006025	And Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her father’s household and all who belonged to her, because she hid the men Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho. So she has lived among the Israelites to this day. 
06006026	At that time Joshua invoked this solemn oath: “Cursed before the LORD is the man who rises up and rebuilds this city, Jericho; at the cost of his firstborn he will lay its foundations; at the cost of his youngest he will set up its gates.” 
06006027	So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout the land. 
06007001	The Israelites, however, acted unfaithfully regarding the things devoted to destruction. Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of what was set apart. So the anger of the LORD burned against the Israelites. 
06007002	Meanwhile, Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven to the east of Bethel, and told them, “Go up and spy out the land.” So the men went up and spied out Ai. 
06007003	On returning to Joshua, they reported, “There is no need to send all the people; two or three thousand men are enough to go up and attack Ai. Since the people of Ai are so few, you need not wear out all our people there.” 
06007004	So about three thousand men went up, but they fled before the men of Ai. 
06007005	And the men of Ai struck down about thirty-six of them, chasing them from the gate as far as the quarries and striking them down on the slopes. So the hearts of the people melted and became like water. 
06007006	Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell facedown before the ark of the LORD until evening, as did the elders of Israel; and they all sprinkled dust on their heads. 
06007007	“O, Lord GOD,” Joshua said, “why did You ever bring this people across the Jordan to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to be destroyed? If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan! 
06007008	O Lord, what can I say, now that Israel has turned its back and run from its enemies? 
06007009	When the Canaanites and all who live in the land hear about this, they will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth. Then what will You do for Your great name?” 
06007010	But the LORD said to Joshua, “Stand up! Why have you fallen on your face? 
06007011	Israel has sinned; they have transgressed My covenant that I commanded them, and they have taken some of what was devoted to destruction. Indeed, they have stolen and lied, and they have put these things with their own possessions. 
06007012	This is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies. They will turn their backs and run from their enemies, because they themselves have been set apart for destruction. I will no longer be with you unless you remove from among you whatever is devoted to destruction. 
06007013	Get up and consecrate the people, saying, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Among you, O Israel, there are things devoted to destruction. You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove them. 
06007014	In the morning you must present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe that the LORD selects shall come forward clan by clan, and the clan that the LORD selects shall come forward family by family, and the family that the LORD selects shall come forward man by man. 
06007015	The one who is caught with the things devoted to destruction must be burned, along with all that belongs to him, because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD and committed an outrage in Israel.’” 
06007016	So Joshua arose early the next morning and had Israel come forward tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was selected. 
06007017	He had the clans of Judah come forward, and the clan of the Zerahites was selected. He had the clan of the Zerahites come forward, and the family of Zabdi was selected. 
06007018	And he had the family of Zabdi come forward man by man, and Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected. 
06007019	So Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory to the LORD, the God of Israel, and make a confession to Him. I urge you to tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me.” 
06007020	“It is true,” Achan replied, “I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel. This is what I did: 
06007021	When I saw among the spoils a beautiful cloak from Shinar, two hundred shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath.” 
06007022	So Joshua sent messengers who ran to the tent, and there it all was, hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath. 
06007023	They took the things from inside the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites, and spread them out before the LORD. 
06007024	Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the cloak, the bar of gold, his sons and daughters, his oxen and donkeys and sheep, his tent, and everything else he owned, and brought them to the Valley of Achor. 
06007025	“Why have you brought this trouble upon us?” said Joshua. “Today the LORD will bring trouble upon you!” And all Israel stoned him to death. Then they stoned the others and burned their bodies. 
06007026	And they heaped over Achan a large pile of rocks that remains to this day. So the LORD turned from His burning anger. Therefore that place is called the Valley of Achor to this day. 
06008001	Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid or discouraged. Take the whole army with you, and go up and attack Ai. See, I have delivered into your hand the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land. 
06008002	And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king, except that you may carry off their plunder and livestock for yourselves. Set up an ambush behind the city.” 
06008003	So Joshua and the whole army set out to attack Ai. Joshua chose 30,000 mighty men of valor and sent them out at night 
06008004	with these orders: “Pay attention. You are to lie in ambush behind the city, not too far from it. All of you must be ready. 
06008005	Then I and all the troops with me will advance on the city. When they come out against us as they did the first time, we will flee from them. 
06008006	They will pursue us until we have drawn them away from the city, for they will say, ‘The Israelites are running away from us as they did before.’ So as we flee from them, 
06008007	you are to rise from the ambush and seize the city, for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand. 
06008008	And when you have taken the city, set it on fire. Do as the LORD has commanded! See, I have given you orders.” 
06008009	So Joshua sent them out, and they went to the place of ambush and lay in wait between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai. But Joshua spent that night among the people. 
06008010	Joshua got up early the next morning and mobilized his men, and he and the elders of Israel marched before them up to Ai. 
06008011	Then all the troops who were with him marched up and approached the city. They arrived in front of Ai and camped to the north of it, with the valley between them and the city. 
06008012	Now Joshua had taken about five thousand men and set up an ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city. 
06008013	So the forces were stationed with the main camp to the north of the city and the rear guard to the west of the city. And that night Joshua went into the valley. 
06008014	When the king of Ai saw the Israelites, he hurried out early in the morning with the men of the city to engage them in battle at an appointed place overlooking the Arabah. But he did not know that an ambush had been set up against him behind the city. 
06008015	Joshua and all Israel let themselves be beaten back before them, and they fled toward the wilderness. 
06008016	Then all the men of Ai were summoned to pursue them, and they followed Joshua and were drawn away from the city. 
06008017	Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel, leaving the city wide open while they pursued Israel. 
06008018	Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Hold out your battle lance toward Ai, for into your hand I will deliver the city.” So Joshua held out his battle lance toward Ai, 
06008019	and as soon as he did so, the men in ambush rose quickly from their position. They rushed forward, entered the city, captured it, and immediately set it on fire. 
06008020	When the men of Ai turned and looked back, the smoke of the city was rising into the sky. They could not escape in any direction, and the troops who had fled to the wilderness now turned against their pursuers. 
06008021	When Joshua and all Israel saw that the men in ambush had captured the city and that smoke was rising from it, they turned around and struck down the men of Ai. 
06008022	Meanwhile, those in the ambush came out of the city against them, and the men of Ai were trapped between the Israelite forces on both sides. So Israel struck them down until no survivor or fugitive remained. 
06008023	But they took the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua. 
06008024	When Israel had finished killing all the men of Ai who had pursued them into the field and wilderness, and when every last one of them had fallen by the sword, all the Israelites returned to Ai and put it to the sword as well. 
06008025	A total of twelve thousand men and women fell that day—all the people of Ai. 
06008026	Joshua did not draw back the hand that held his battle lance until he had devoted to destruction all who lived in Ai. 
06008027	Israel took for themselves only the cattle and plunder of that city, as the LORD had commanded Joshua. 
06008028	So Joshua burned Ai and made it a permanent heap of ruins, a desolation to this day. 
06008029	He hung the king of Ai on a tree until evening, and at sunset Joshua commanded that they take down the body from the tree and throw it down at the entrance of the city gate. And over it they raised a large pile of rocks, which remains to this day. 
06008030	At that time Joshua built an altar on Mount Ebal to the LORD, the God of Israel, 
06008031	just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the Israelites. He built it according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses: “an altar of uncut stones on which no iron tool has been used.” And on it they offered burnt offerings to the LORD, and they sacrificed peace offerings. 
06008032	And there in the presence of the Israelites, Joshua inscribed on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written. 
06008033	All Israel, foreigners and citizens alike, with their elders, officers, and judges, stood on both sides of the ark of the covenant of the LORD facing the Levitical priests who carried it. Half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded earlier, to bless the people of Israel. 
06008034	Afterward, Joshua read aloud all the words of the law—the blessings and the curses—according to all that is written in the Book of the Law. 
06008035	There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua failed to read before the whole assembly of Israel, including the women, the little ones, and the foreigners who lived among them. 
06009001	Now when news of this reached all the kings west of the Jordan—those in the hill country, the foothills, and all along the coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon (the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites)— 
06009002	they came together to wage war against Joshua and Israel. 
06009003	But the people of Gibeon, having heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, 
06009004	acted deceptively and set out as envoys, carrying on their donkeys worn-out sacks and old wineskins, cracked and mended. 
06009005	They put worn, patched sandals on their feet and threadbare clothing on their bodies, and their whole supply of bread was dry and moldy. 
06009006	They went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the men of Israel, “We have come from a distant land; please make a treaty with us.” 
06009007	But the men of Israel said to the Hivites, “Perhaps you dwell near us. How can we make a treaty with you?” 
06009008	“We are your servants,” they said to Joshua. Then Joshua asked them, “Who are you and where have you come from?” 
06009009	“Your servants have come from a very distant land,” they replied, “because of the fame of the LORD your God. For we have heard the reports about Him: all that He did in Egypt, 
06009010	and all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites beyond the Jordan—Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth. 
06009011	So the elders and inhabitants of our land told us, ‘Take provisions for your journey; go to meet them and say to them: We are your servants. Please make a treaty with us.’ 
06009012	This bread of ours was warm when we packed it at home on the day we left to come to you. But look, it is now dry and moldy. 
06009013	These wineskins were new when we filled them, but look, they are cracked. And these clothes and sandals are worn out from our very long journey.” 
06009014	Then the men of Israel sampled their provisions but did not seek the counsel of the LORD. 
06009015	And Joshua made a treaty of peace with them to let them live, and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to them. 
06009016	Three days after they had made the treaty with the Gibeonites, the Israelites learned that they were neighbors, living among them. 
06009017	So the Israelites set out and on the third day arrived at their cities—Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim. 
06009018	But the Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn an oath to them by the LORD, the God of Israel. And the whole congregation grumbled against the leaders. 
06009019	All the leaders answered, “We have sworn an oath to them by the LORD, the God of Israel, and now we cannot touch them. 
06009020	This is how we will treat them: We will let them live, so that no wrath will fall on us because of the oath we swore to them.” 
06009021	They continued, “Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and water carriers for the whole congregation.” So the leaders kept their promise. 
06009022	Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said, “Why did you deceive us by telling us you live far away from us, when in fact you live among us? 
06009023	Now therefore you are under a curse and will perpetually serve as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.” 
06009024	The Gibeonites answered, “Your servants were told clearly that the LORD your God had commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land and wipe out all its inhabitants before you. So we greatly feared for our lives because of you, and that is why we have done this. 
06009025	Now we are in your hands. Do to us whatever seems good and right to you.” 
06009026	So Joshua did this and delivered them from the hands of the Israelites, and they did not kill the Gibeonites. 
06009027	On that day he made them woodcutters and water carriers, as they are to this day for the congregation of the LORD and for the altar at the place He would choose. 
06010001	Now Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured Ai and devoted it to destruction —doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king—and that the people of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were living near them. 
06010002	So Adoni-zedek and his people were greatly alarmed, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities; it was larger than Ai, and all its men were mighty. 
06010003	Therefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent word to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon, saying, 
06010004	“Come up and help me. We will attack Gibeon, because they have made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.” 
06010005	So the five kings of the Amorites—the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon—joined forces and advanced with all their armies. They camped before Gibeon and made war against it. 
06010006	Then the men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal: “Do not abandon your servants. Come quickly and save us! Help us, because all the kings of the Amorites from the hill country have joined forces against us.” 
06010007	So Joshua and his whole army, including all the mighty men of valor, came from Gilgal. 
06010008	The LORD said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them, for I have delivered them into your hand. Not one of them shall stand against you.” 
06010009	After marching all night from Gilgal, Joshua caught them by surprise. 
06010010	And the LORD threw them into confusion before Israel, who defeated them in a great slaughter at Gibeon, pursued them along the ascent to Beth-horon, and struck them down as far as Azekah and Makkedah. 
06010011	As they fled before Israel along the descent from Beth-horon to Azekah, the LORD cast down on them large hailstones from the sky, and more of them were killed by the hailstones than by the swords of the Israelites. 
06010012	On the day that the LORD gave the Amorites over to the Israelites, Joshua spoke to the LORD in the presence of Israel: “O sun, stand still over Gibeon, O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon.” 
06010013	So the sun stood still and the moon stopped until the nation took vengeance upon its enemies. Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? “So the sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day.” 
06010014	There has been no day like it before or since, when the LORD listened to the voice of a man, because the LORD fought for Israel. 
06010015	Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal. 
06010016	Now the five kings had fled and hidden in the cave at Makkedah. 
06010017	And Joshua was informed: “The five kings have been found; they are hiding in the cave at Makkedah.” 
06010018	So Joshua said, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and post men there to guard them. 
06010019	But you, do not stop there. Pursue your enemies and attack them from behind. Do not let them reach their cities, for the LORD your God has delivered them into your hand.” 
06010020	So Joshua and the Israelites continued to inflict a terrible slaughter until they had finished them off, and the remaining survivors retreated to the fortified cities. 
06010021	The whole army returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah, and no one dared to utter a word against the Israelites. 
06010022	Then Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me.” 
06010023	So they brought the five kings out of the cave—the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon. 
06010024	When they had brought the kings to Joshua, he summoned all the men of Israel and said to the army commanders who had accompanied him, “Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings.” So the commanders came forward and put their feet on their necks. 
06010025	“Do not be afraid or discouraged,” Joshua said. “Be strong and courageous, for the LORD will do this to all the enemies you fight.” 
06010026	After this, Joshua struck down and killed the kings, and he hung their bodies on five trees and left them there until evening. 
06010027	At sunset Joshua ordered that they be taken down from the trees and thrown into the cave in which they had hidden. Then large stones were placed against the mouth of the cave, and the stones are there to this day. 
06010028	On that day Joshua captured Makkedah and put it to the sword, along with its king. He devoted to destruction everyone in the city, leaving no survivors. So he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho. 
06010029	Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Makkedah to Libnah and fought against Libnah. 
06010030	And the LORD also delivered that city and its king into the hand of Israel, and Joshua put all the people to the sword, leaving no survivors. And he did to the king of Libnah as he had done to the king of Jericho. 
06010031	And Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Libnah to Lachish. They laid siege to it and fought against it. 
06010032	And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, and Joshua captured it on the second day. He put all the people to the sword, just as he had done to Libnah. 
06010033	At that time Horam king of Gezer went to help Lachish, but Joshua struck him down along with his people, leaving no survivors. 
06010034	So Joshua moved on from Lachish to Eglon, and all Israel with him. They laid siege to it and fought against it. 
06010035	That day they captured Eglon and put it to the sword, and Joshua devoted to destruction everyone in the city, just as he had done to Lachish. 
06010036	Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron and fought against it. 
06010037	They captured it and put to the sword its king, all its villages, and all the people. Joshua left no survivors, just as he had done at Eglon; he devoted to destruction Hebron and everyone in it. 
06010038	Finally Joshua and all Israel with him turned toward Debir and fought against it. 
06010039	And they captured Debir, its king, and all its villages. They put them to the sword and devoted to destruction everyone in the city, leaving no survivors. Joshua did to Debir and its king as he had done to Hebron and as he had done to Libnah and its king. 
06010040	So Joshua conquered the whole region—the hill country, the Negev, the foothills, and the slopes, together with all their kings—leaving no survivors. He devoted to destruction everything that breathed, just as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded. 
06010041	Joshua conquered the area from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza, and the whole region of Goshen as far as Gibeon. 
06010042	And because the LORD, the God of Israel, fought for Israel, Joshua captured all these kings and their land in one campaign. 
06010043	Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal. 
06011001	Now when Jabin king of Hazor heard about these things, he sent word to Jobab king of Madon; to the kings of Shimron and Achshaph; 
06011002	to the kings of the north in the mountains, in the Arabah south of Chinnereth, in the foothills, and in Naphoth-dor to the west; 
06011003	to the Canaanites in the east and west; to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, and Jebusites in the hill country; and to the Hivites at the foot of Hermon in the land of Mizpah. 
06011004	So these kings came out with all their armies, a multitude as numerous as the sand on the seashore, along with a great number of horses and chariots. 
06011005	All these kings joined forces and encamped at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel. 
06011006	Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them, for by this time tomorrow I will deliver all of them slain before Israel. You are to hamstring their horses and burn up their chariots.” 
06011007	So by the waters of Merom, Joshua and his whole army came upon them suddenly and attacked them, 
06011008	and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who struck them down and pursued them all the way to Greater Sidon and Misrephoth-maim, and eastward as far as the Valley of Mizpeh. They struck them down, leaving no survivors. 
06011009	Joshua treated them as the LORD had told him; he hamstrung their horses and burned up their chariots. 
06011010	At that time Joshua turned back and captured Hazor and put its king to the sword, because Hazor was formerly the head of all these kingdoms. 
06011011	The Israelites put everyone in Hazor to the sword, devoting them to destruction. Nothing that breathed remained, and Joshua burned down Hazor itself. 
06011012	Joshua captured all these kings and their cities and put them to the sword. He devoted them to destruction, as Moses the LORD’s servant had commanded. 
06011013	Yet Israel did not burn any of the cities built on their mounds, except Hazor, which Joshua burned. 
06011014	The Israelites took for themselves all the plunder and livestock of these cities, but they put all the people to the sword until they had completely destroyed them, not sparing anyone who breathed. 
06011015	As the LORD had commanded His servant Moses, so Moses commanded Joshua. That is what Joshua did, leaving nothing undone of all that the LORD had commanded Moses. 
06011016	So Joshua took this entire region: the hill country, all the Negev, all the land of Goshen, the western foothills, the Arabah, and the mountains of Israel and their foothills, 
06011017	from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, as far as Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon at the foot of Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings and struck them down, putting them to death. 
06011018	Joshua waged war against all these kings for a long period of time. 
06011019	No city made peace with the Israelites except the Hivites living in Gibeon; all others were taken in battle. 
06011020	For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts to engage Israel in battle, so that they would be set apart for destruction and would receive no mercy, being annihilated as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
06011021	At that time Joshua proceeded to eliminate the Anakim from the hill country of Hebron, Debir, and Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah and of Israel. Joshua devoted them to destruction, along with their cities. 
06011022	No Anakim were left in the land of the Israelites; only in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod did any survive. 
06011023	So Joshua took the entire land, in keeping with all that the LORD had spoken to Moses. And Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to the allotments to their tribes. Then the land had rest from war. 
06012001	Now these are the kings of the land whom the Israelites struck down and whose lands they took beyond the Jordan to the east, from the Arnon Valley to Mount Hermon, including all the Arabah eastward: 
06012002	Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon. He ruled from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley, along the middle of the valley, up to the Jabbok River (the border of the Ammonites), that is, half of Gilead, 
06012003	as well as the Arabah east of the Sea of Chinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea ), eastward through Beth-jeshimoth, and southward below the slopes of Pisgah. 
06012004	And Og king of Bashan, one of the remnant of the Rephaim, who lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei. 
06012005	He ruled over Mount Hermon, Salecah, all of Bashan up to the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and half of Gilead to the border of Sihon king of Heshbon. 
06012006	Moses, the servant of the LORD, and the Israelites had struck them down and given their land as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. 
06012007	And these are the kings of the land that Joshua and the Israelites conquered beyond the Jordan to the west, from Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir (according to the allotments to the tribes of Israel, Joshua gave them as an inheritance 
06012008	the hill country, the foothills, the Arabah, the slopes, the wilderness, and the Negev—the lands of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites): 
06012009	the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is near Bethel, one; 
06012010	the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; 
06012011	the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one; 
06012012	the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one; 
06012013	the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one; 
06012014	the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one; 
06012015	the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one; 
06012016	the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one; 
06012017	the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one; 
06012018	the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one; 
06012019	the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one; 
06012020	the king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one; 
06012021	the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one; 
06012022	the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one; 
06012023	the king of Dor in Naphath-dor, one; the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one; 
06012024	and the king of Tirzah, one. So there were thirty-one kings in all. 
06013001	Now Joshua was old and well along in years, and the LORD said to him, “You are old and well along in years, but very much of the land remains to be possessed. 
06013002	This is the land that remains: All the territory of the Philistines and the Geshurites, 
06013003	from the Shihor east of Egypt to the territory of Ekron on the north (considered to be Canaanite territory)—that of the five Philistine rulers of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron, as well as that of the Avvites; 
06013004	to the south, all the land of the Canaanites, from Mearah of the Sidonians to Aphek, as far as the border of the Amorites; 
06013005	the land of the Gebalites; and all Lebanon to the east, from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon to Lebo-hamath. 
06013006	All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim—all the Sidonians—I Myself will drive out before the Israelites. Be sure to divide it by lot as an inheritance to Israel, as I have commanded you. 
06013007	Now therefore divide this land as an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.” 
06013008	The other half of Manasseh, along with the Reubenites and Gadites, had received the inheritance Moses had given them beyond the Jordan to the east, just as Moses the servant of the LORD had assigned to them: 
06013009	The area from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley, along with the city in the middle of the valley, the whole plateau of Medeba as far as Dibon, 
06013010	and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon, as far as the border of the Ammonites; 
06013011	also Gilead and the territory of the Geshurites and Maacathites, all of Mount Hermon, and all Bashan as far as Salecah— 
06013012	the whole kingdom of Og in Bashan, who had reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei and had remained as a remnant of the Rephaim. Moses had struck them down and dispossessed them, 
06013013	but the Israelites did not drive out the Geshurites or the Maacathites. So Geshur and Maacath dwell among the Israelites to this day. 
06013014	To the tribe of Levi, however, Moses had given no inheritance. The food offerings to the LORD, the God of Israel, are their inheritance, just as He had promised them. 
06013015	This is what Moses had given to the clans of the tribe of Reuben: 
06013016	The territory from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley, along with the city in the middle of the valley, to the whole plateau beyond Medeba, 
06013017	to Heshbon and all its cities on the plateau, including Dibon, Bamoth-baal, Beth-baal-meon, 
06013018	Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath, 
06013019	Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth-shahar on the hill in the valley, 
06013020	Beth-peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth— 
06013021	all the cities of the plateau and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon until Moses killed him and the chiefs of Midian (Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba), the princes of Sihon who lived in the land. 
06013022	The Israelites also killed the diviner Balaam son of Beor along with the others they put to the sword. 
06013023	And the border of the Reubenites was the bank of the Jordan. This was the inheritance of the clans of the Reubenites, including the cities and villages. 
06013024	This is what Moses had given to the clans of the tribe of Gad: 
06013025	The territory of Jazer, all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the Ammonites as far as Aroer, near Rabbah; 
06013026	the territory from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir; 
06013027	and in the valley, Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, with the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon (the territory on the east side of the Jordan up to the edge of the Sea of Chinnereth ). 
06013028	This was the inheritance of the clans of the Gadites, including the cities and villages. 
06013029	This is what Moses had given to the clans of the half-tribe of Manasseh, that is, to half the tribe of the descendants of Manasseh: 
06013030	The territory from Mahanaim through all Bashan—all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, including all the towns of Jair that are in Bashan, sixty cities; 
06013031	half of Gilead; and Ashtaroth and Edrei, the royal cities of Og in Bashan. All this was for the clans of the descendants of Machir son of Manasseh, that is, half of the descendants of Machir. 
06013032	These were the portions Moses had given them on the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan, east of Jericho. 
06013033	To the tribe of Levi, however, Moses had given no inheritance. The LORD, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, just as He had promised them. 
06014001	Now these are the portions that the Israelites inherited in the land of Canaan, as distributed by Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the families of the tribes of Israel. 
06014002	Their inheritance was assigned by lot for the nine and a half tribes, as the LORD had commanded through Moses. 
06014003	For Moses had given the inheritance east of the Jordan to the other two and a half tribes. But he granted no inheritance among them to the Levites. 
06014004	The descendants of Joseph became two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. And no portion of the land was given to the Levites, except for cities in which to live, along with pasturelands for their flocks and herds. 
06014005	So the Israelites did as the LORD had commanded Moses, and they divided the land. 
06014006	Then the sons of Judah approached Joshua at Gilgal, and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know what the LORD said to Moses the man of God at Kadesh-barnea about you and me. 
06014007	I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land, and I brought back to him an honest report. 
06014008	Although my brothers who went with me made the hearts of the people melt with fear, I remained loyal to the LORD my God. 
06014009	On that day Moses swore to me, saying, ‘Surely the land on which you have set foot will be an inheritance to you and your children forever, because you have wholly followed the LORD my God.’ 
06014010	Now behold, as the LORD promised, He has kept me alive these forty-five years since He spoke this word to Moses, while Israel wandered in the wilderness. So here I am today, eighty-five years old, 
06014011	still as strong today as I was the day Moses sent me out. As my strength was then, so it is now for war, for going out, and for coming in. 
06014012	Now therefore give me this hill country that the LORD promised me on that day, for you yourself heard then that the Anakim were there, with great and fortified cities. Perhaps with the LORD’s help I will drive them out, as the LORD has spoken.” 
06014013	Then Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as his inheritance. 
06014014	Therefore Hebron belongs to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite as an inheritance to this day, because he wholly followed the LORD, the God of Israel. 
06014015	(Hebron used to be called Kiriath-arba, after Arba, the greatest man among the Anakim.) Then the land had rest from war. 
06015001	Now the allotment for the clans of the tribe of Judah extended to the border of Edom, to the Wilderness of Zin at the extreme southern boundary: 
06015002	Their southern border started at the bay on the southern tip of the Salt Sea, 
06015003	proceeded south of the Ascent of Akrabbim, continued on to Zin, went over to the south of Kadesh-barnea, ran past Hezron up to Addar, and curved toward Karka. 
06015004	It proceeded to Azmon, joined the Brook of Egypt, and ended at the Sea. This was their southern border. 
06015005	The eastern border was the Salt Sea as far as the mouth of the Jordan. The northern border started from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan, 
06015006	went up to Beth-hoglah, proceeded north of Beth-arabah, and went up to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben. 
06015007	Then the border went up to Debir from the Valley of Achor, turning north to Gilgal, which faces the Ascent of Adummim south of the ravine. It continued along the waters of En-shemesh and came out at En-rogel. 
06015008	From there the border went up the Valley of Ben-hinnom along the southern slope of the Jebusites (that is, Jerusalem) and ascended to the top of the hill that faces the Valley of Hinnom on the west, at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim. 
06015009	From the hilltop the border curved to the spring of the Waters of Nephtoah, proceeded to the cities of Mount Ephron, and then bent around toward Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim). 
06015010	The border curled westward from Baalah to Mount Seir, ran along the northern slope of Mount Jearim (that is, Chesalon), went down to Beth-shemesh, and crossed to Timnah. 
06015011	Then it went out to the northern slope of Ekron, curved toward Shikkeron, proceeded to Mount Baalah, went on to Jabneel, and ended at the Sea. 
06015012	And the western border was the coastline of the Great Sea. These are the boundaries around the clans of the descendants of Judah. 
06015013	According to the LORD’s command to him, Joshua gave Caleb son of Jephunneh a portion among the sons of Judah—Kiriath-arba, that is, Hebron. (Arba was the forefather of Anak.) 
06015014	And Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak—the descendants of Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak. 
06015015	From there he marched against the inhabitants of Debir (formerly known as Kiriath-sepher). 
06015016	And Caleb said, “To the man who strikes down Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage.” 
06015017	So Othniel son of Caleb’s brother Kenaz captured the city, and Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to him in marriage. 
06015018	One day Acsah came to Othniel and urged him to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What do you desire?” 
06015019	“Give me a blessing,” she answered. “Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me springs of water as well.” So Caleb gave her both the upper and lower springs. 
06015020	This is the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Judah. 
06015021	These were the southernmost cities of the tribe of Judah in the Negev toward the border of Edom: Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur, 
06015022	Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah, 
06015023	Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan, 
06015024	Ziph, Telem, Bealoth, 
06015025	Hazor-hadattah, Kerioth-hezron (that is, Hazor), 
06015026	Amam, Shema, Moladah, 
06015027	Hazar-gaddah, Heshmon, Beth-pelet, 
06015028	Hazar-shual, Beersheba, Biziothiah, 
06015029	Baalah, Iim, Ezem, 
06015030	Eltolad, Chesil, Hormah, 
06015031	Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah, 
06015032	Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon—twenty-nine cities in all, along with their villages. 
06015033	These were in the foothills: Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah, 
06015034	Zanoah, En-gannim, Tappuah, Enam, 
06015035	Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, Azekah, 
06015036	Shaaraim, Adithaim, and Gederah (or Gederothaim)—fourteen cities, along with their villages. 
06015037	Zenan, Hadashah, Migdal-gad, 
06015038	Dilan, Mizpeh, Joktheel, 
06015039	Lachish, Bozkath, Eglon, 
06015040	Cabbon, Lahmas, Chitlish, 
06015041	Gederoth, Beth-dagon, Naamah, and Makkedah—sixteen cities, along with their villages. 
06015042	Libnah, Ether, Ashan, 
06015043	Iphtah, Ashnah, Nezib, 
06015044	Keilah, Achzib, and Mareshah—nine cities, along with their villages. 
06015045	Ekron, with its towns and villages; 
06015046	from Ekron to the sea, all the cities near Ashdod, along with their villages; 
06015047	Ashdod, with its towns and villages; Gaza, with its towns and villages, as far as the Brook of Egypt and the coastline of the Great Sea. 
06015048	These were in the hill country: Shamir, Jattir, Socoh, 
06015049	Dannah, Kiriath-sannah (that is, Debir), 
06015050	Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim, 
06015051	Goshen, Holon, and Giloh—eleven cities, along with their villages. 
06015052	Arab, Dumah, Eshan, 
06015053	Janim, Beth-tappuah, Aphekah, 
06015054	Humtah, Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), and Zior—nine cities, along with their villages. 
06015055	Maon, Carmel, Ziph, Juttah, 
06015056	Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah, 
06015057	Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah—ten cities, along with their villages. 
06015058	Halhul, Beth-zur, Gedor, 
06015059	Maarath, Beth-anoth, and Eltekon—six cities, along with their villages. 
06015060	Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), and Rabbah—two cities, along with their villages. 
06015061	These were in the wilderness: Beth-arabah, Middin, Secacah, 
06015062	Nibshan, the City of Salt, and En-gedi—six cities, along with their villages. 
06015063	But the descendants of Judah could not drive out the Jebusites living in Jerusalem. So to this day the Jebusites live there among the descendants of Judah. 
06016001	The allotment for the descendants of Joseph extended from the Jordan at Jericho to the waters of Jericho on the east, through the wilderness that goes up from Jericho into the hill country of Bethel. 
06016002	It went on from Bethel (that is, Luz) and proceeded to the border of the Archites in Ataroth. 
06016003	Then it descended westward to the border of the Japhletites as far as the border of Lower Beth-horon and on to Gezer, and it ended at the Sea. 
06016004	So Ephraim and Manasseh, the sons of Joseph, received their inheritance. 
06016005	This was the territory of the descendants of Ephraim by their clans: The border of their inheritance went from Ataroth-addar in the east to Upper Beth-horon 
06016006	and out toward the Sea. From Michmethath on the north it turned eastward toward Taanath-shiloh and passed by it to Janoah on the east. 
06016007	From Janoah it went down to Ataroth and Naarah, and then reached Jericho and came out at the Jordan. 
06016008	From Tappuah the border went westward to the Brook of Kanah and ended at the Sea. This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Ephraim, 
06016009	along with all the cities and villages set apart for the descendants of Ephraim within the inheritance of Manasseh. 
06016010	But they did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer. So the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites to this day, but they are forced laborers. 
06017001	Now this was the allotment for the tribe of Manasseh as Joseph’s firstborn son, namely for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh and father of the Gileadites, who had received Gilead and Bashan because Machir was a man of war. 
06017002	So this allotment was for the rest of the descendants of Manasseh—the clans of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These are the other male descendants of the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph. 
06017003	But Zelophehad son of Hepher (the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh) had no sons but only daughters. These are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 
06017004	They approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders, and said, “The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers.” So Joshua gave them an inheritance among their father’s brothers, in keeping with the command of the LORD. 
06017005	Thus ten shares fell to Manasseh, in addition to the land of Gilead and Bashan beyond the Jordan, 
06017006	because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons. And the land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh. 
06017007	Now the border of Manasseh went from Asher to Michmethath near Shechem, then southward to include the inhabitants of En-tappuah. 
06017008	The region of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but Tappuah itself, on the border of Manasseh, belonged to Ephraim. 
06017009	From there the border continued southward to the Brook of Kanah. There were cities belonging to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh, but the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook and ended at the Sea. 
06017010	Ephraim’s territory was to the south, and Manasseh’s was to the north, having the Sea as its border and adjoining Asher on the north and Issachar on the east. 
06017011	Within Issachar and Asher, Manasseh was assigned Beth-shean, Ibleam, Dor (that is, Naphath), Endor, Taanach, and Megiddo, each with their surrounding settlements. 
06017012	But the descendants of Manasseh were unable to occupy these cities, because the Canaanites were determined to stay in this land. 
06017013	However, when the Israelites grew stronger, they put the Canaanites to forced labor; but they failed to drive them out completely. 
06017014	Then the sons of Joseph said to Joshua, “Why have you given us only one portion as an inheritance? We have many people, because the LORD has blessed us abundantly.” 
06017015	Joshua answered them, “If you have so many people that the hill country of Ephraim is too small for you, go to the forest and clear for yourself an area in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim.” 
06017016	“The hill country is not enough for us,” they replied, “and all the Canaanites who live in the valley have iron chariots, both in Beth-shean with its towns and in the Valley of Jezreel.” 
06017017	So Joshua said to the house of Joseph—to Ephraim and Manasseh—“You have many people and great strength. You shall not have just one allotment, 
06017018	because the hill country will be yours as well. It is a forest; clear it, and its farthest limits will be yours. Although the Canaanites have iron chariots and although they are strong, you can drive them out.” 
06018001	Then the whole congregation of Israel assembled at Shiloh and set up the Tent of Meeting there. And though the land was subdued before them, 
06018002	there were still seven tribes of Israel who had not yet received their inheritance. 
06018003	So Joshua said to the Israelites, “How long will you put off entering and possessing the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you? 
06018004	Appoint three men from each tribe, and I will send them out to survey the land and map it out, according to the inheritance of each. Then they will return to me 
06018005	and divide the land into seven portions. Judah shall remain in their territory in the south, and the house of Joseph shall remain in their territory in the north. 
06018006	When you have mapped out the seven portions of land and brought it to me, I will cast lots for you here in the presence of the LORD our God. 
06018007	The Levites, however, have no portion among you, because their inheritance is the priesthood of the LORD. And Gad, Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh have already received the inheritance that Moses the servant of the LORD gave them beyond the Jordan to the east.” 
06018008	As the men got up to go out, Joshua commanded them to map out the land, saying, “Go and survey the land, map it out, and return to me. Then I will cast lots for you here in Shiloh in the presence of the LORD.” 
06018009	So the men departed and went throughout the land, mapping it city by city into seven portions. Then they returned with the document to Joshua at the camp in Shiloh. 
06018010	And Joshua cast lots for them in the presence of the LORD at Shiloh, where he distributed the land to the Israelites according to their divisions. 
06018011	The first lot came up for the clans of the tribe of Benjamin. Their allotted territory lay between the tribes of Judah and Joseph: 
06018012	On the north side their border began at the Jordan, went up past the northern slope of Jericho, headed west through the hill country, and came out at the wilderness of Beth-aven. 
06018013	From there the border crossed over to the southern slope of Luz (that is, Bethel) and went down to Ataroth-addar on the hill south of Lower Beth-horon. 
06018014	On the west side the border curved southward from the hill facing Beth-horon on the south and came out at Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), a city of the sons of Judah. This was the western side. 
06018015	On the south side the border began at the outskirts of Kiriath-jearim and extended westward to the spring at the Waters of Nephtoah. 
06018016	Then it went down to the foot of the hill that faces the Valley of Ben-hinnom at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim and ran down the Valley of Hinnom toward the southern slope of the Jebusites and downward to En-rogel. 
06018017	From there it curved northward and proceeded to En-shemesh and on to Geliloth facing the Ascent of Adummim, and continued down to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben. 
06018018	Then it went on to the northern slope of Beth-arabah and went down into the valley. 
06018019	The border continued to the northern slope of Beth-hoglah and came out at the northern bay of the Salt Sea, at the mouth of the Jordan. This was the southern border. 
06018020	On the east side the border was the Jordan. These were the borders around the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Benjamin. 
06018021	These were the cities of the clans of the tribe of Benjamin: Jericho, Beth-hoglah, Emek-keziz, 
06018022	Beth-arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel, 
06018023	Avvim, Parah, Ophrah, 
06018024	Chephar-ammoni, Ophni, and Geba—twelve cities, along with their villages. 
06018025	Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth, 
06018026	Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah, 
06018027	Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah, 
06018028	Zelah, Haeleph, Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah, and Kiriath-jearim —fourteen cities, along with their villages. This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Benjamin. 
06019001	The second lot came out for the clans of the tribe of Simeon: Their inheritance lay within the territory of Judah 
06019002	and included Beersheba (or Sheba), Moladah, 
06019003	Hazar-shual, Balah, Ezem, 
06019004	Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah, 
06019005	Ziklag, Beth-marcaboth, Hazar-susah, 
06019006	Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen—thirteen cities, along with their villages. 
06019007	Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan—four cities, along with their villages, 
06019008	and all the villages surrounding these cities as far as Baalath-beer (Ramah of the Negev). This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Simeon. 
06019009	The inheritance of the Simeonites was taken from the territory of Judah, because the share for Judah’s descendants was too large for them. So the Simeonites received an inheritance within Judah’s portion. 
06019010	The third lot came up for the clans of the tribe of Zebulun: The border of their inheritance stretched as far as Sarid. 
06019011	It went up westward to Maralah, reached Dabbesheth, and met the brook east of Jokneam. 
06019012	From Sarid it turned eastward along the border of Chisloth-tabor and went on to Daberath and up to Japhia. 
06019013	From there it crossed eastward to Gath-hepher and to Eth-kazin; it extended to Rimmon and curved around toward Neah. 
06019014	Then the border circled around the north side of Neah to Hannathon and ended at the Valley of Iphtah-el. 
06019015	It also included Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem. There were twelve cities, along with their villages. 
06019016	This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Zebulun, including these cities and their villages. 
06019017	The fourth lot came out for the clans of the tribe of Issachar: 
06019018	Their territory included Jezreel, Chesulloth, Shunem, 
06019019	Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath, 
06019020	Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez, 
06019021	Remeth, En-gannim, En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez. 
06019022	The border reached Tabor, Shahazumah, and Beth-shemesh, and ended at the Jordan. There were sixteen cities, along with their villages. 
06019023	This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Issachar, including these cities and their villages. 
06019024	The fifth lot came out for the clans of the tribe of Asher: 
06019025	Their territory included Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph, 
06019026	Allammelech, Amad, and Mishal. On the west the border touched Carmel and Shihor-libnath, 
06019027	then turned eastward toward Beth-dagon, touched Zebulun and the Valley of Iphtah-el, and went north to Beth-emek and Neiel, passing Cabul on the left. 
06019028	It went on to Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, as far as Greater Sidon. 
06019029	The border then turned back toward Ramah as far as the fortified city of Tyre, turned toward Hosah, and came out at the Sea in the region of Achzib, 
06019030	Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob. There were twenty-two cities, along with their villages. 
06019031	This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Asher, including these cities and their villages. 
06019032	The sixth lot came out for the clans of the tribe of Naphtali: 
06019033	Their border started at Heleph and the great tree of Zaanannim, passing Adami-nekeb and Jabneel as far as Lakkum and ending at the Jordan. 
06019034	Then the border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor and ran from there to Hukkok, touching Zebulun on the south side, Asher on the west, and Judah at the Jordan on the east. 
06019035	The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth, 
06019036	Adamah, Ramah, Hazor, 
06019037	Kedesh, Edrei, En-hazor, 
06019038	Iron, Migdal-el, Horem, Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh. There were nineteen cities, along with their villages. 
06019039	This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Naphtali, including these cities and their villages. 
06019040	The seventh lot came out for the clans of the tribe of Dan: 
06019041	The territory of their inheritance included Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir-shemesh, 
06019042	Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah, 
06019043	Elon, Timnah, Ekron, 
06019044	Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath, 
06019045	Jehud, Bene-berak, Gath-rimmon, 
06019046	Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, including the territory across from Joppa. 
06019047	(Later, when the territory of the Danites was lost to them, they went up and fought against Leshem, captured it, and put it to the sword. So they took possession of Leshem, settled there, and renamed it after their father Dan.) 
06019048	This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Dan, including these cities and their villages. 
06019049	When they had finished distributing the land into its territories, the Israelites gave Joshua son of Nun an inheritance among them, 
06019050	as the LORD had commanded. They gave him the city of Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim, as he requested. He rebuilt the city and settled in it. 
06019051	These are the inheritances that Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the families distributed by lot to the tribes of Israel at Shiloh before the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. So they finished dividing up the land. 
06020001	Then the LORD said to Joshua, 
06020002	“Tell the Israelites to designate the cities of refuge, as I instructed you through Moses, 
06020003	so that anyone who kills another unintentionally or accidentally may flee there. These will be your refuge from the avenger of blood. 
06020004	When someone flees to one of these cities, stands at the entrance of the city gate, and states his case before its elders, they are to bring him into the city and give him a place to live among them. 
06020005	Now if the avenger of blood pursues him, they must not surrender the manslayer into his hand, because that man killed his neighbor accidentally without prior malice. 
06020006	He is to stay in that city until he stands trial before the assembly and until the death of the high priest serving at that time. Then the manslayer may return to his own home in the city from which he fled.” 
06020007	So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah. 
06020008	And beyond the Jordan, east of Jericho, they designated Bezer on the wilderness plateau from the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh. 
06020009	These are the cities appointed for all the Israelites and foreigners among them, so that anyone who kills a person unintentionally may flee there and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood prior to standing trial before the assembly. 
06021001	Now the family heads of the Levites approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the other tribes of Israel 
06021002	at Shiloh in the land of Canaan and said to them, “The LORD commanded through Moses that we be given cities in which to live, together with pasturelands for our livestock.” 
06021003	So by the command of the LORD, the Israelites gave the Levites these cities and their pasturelands out of their own inheritance: 
06021004	The first lot came out for the Kohathite clans. The Levites who were descendants of Aaron the priest received thirteen cities by lot from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin. 
06021005	The remaining descendants of Kohath received ten cities by lot from the tribes of Ephraim, Dan, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. 
06021006	The descendants of Gershon received thirteen cities by lot from the tribes of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan. 
06021007	And the descendants of Merari received twelve cities from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun. 
06021008	So the Israelites allotted to the Levites these cities, together with their pasturelands, as the LORD had commanded through Moses. 
06021009	From the tribes of Judah and Simeon, they designated these cities by name 
06021010	to the descendants of Aaron from the Kohathite clans of the Levites, because the first lot fell to them: 
06021011	They gave them Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), with its surrounding pasturelands, in the hill country of Judah. (Arba was the father of Anak.) 
06021012	But they had given the fields and villages around the city to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his possession. 
06021013	So to the descendants of Aaron the priest they gave these cities, together with their pasturelands: Hebron, a city of refuge for the manslayer, Libnah, 
06021014	Jattir, Eshtemoa, 
06021015	Holon, Debir, 
06021016	Ain, Juttah, and Beth-shemesh—nine cities from these two tribes, together with their pasturelands. 
06021017	And from the tribe of Benjamin they gave them Gibeon, Geba, 
06021018	Anathoth, and Almon—four cities, together with their pasturelands. 
06021019	In all, thirteen cities, together with their pasturelands, were given to the priests, the descendants of Aaron. 
06021020	The remaining Kohathite clans of the Levites were allotted these cities: From the tribe of Ephraim 
06021021	they were given Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim (a city of refuge for the manslayer), Gezer, 
06021022	Kibzaim, and Beth-horon—four cities, together with their pasturelands. 
06021023	From the tribe of Dan they were given Elteke, Gibbethon, 
06021024	Aijalon, and Gath-rimmon—four cities, together with their pasturelands. 
06021025	And from the half-tribe of Manasseh they were given Taanach and Gath-rimmon—two cities, together with their pasturelands. 
06021026	In all, ten cities, together with their pasturelands, were given to the rest of the Kohathite clans. 
06021027	This is what the Levite clans of the Gershonites were given: From the half-tribe of Manasseh they were given Golan in Bashan, a city of refuge for the manslayer, and Beeshterah—two cities, together with their pasturelands. 
06021028	From the tribe of Issachar they were given Kishion, Daberath, 
06021029	Jarmuth, and En-gannim—four cities, together with their pasturelands. 
06021030	From the tribe of Asher they were given Mishal, Abdon, 
06021031	Helkath, and Rehob—four cities, together with their pasturelands. 
06021032	And from the tribe of Naphtali they were given Kedesh in Galilee (a city of refuge for the manslayer), Hammoth-dor, and Kartan—three cities, together with their pasturelands. 
06021033	In all, thirteen cities, together with their pasturelands, were given to the Gershonite clans. 
06021034	This is what the Merarite clan (the rest of the Levites) were given: From the tribe of Zebulun they were given Jokneam, Kartah, 
06021035	Dimnah, and Nahalal—four cities, together with their pasturelands. 
06021036	From the tribe of Reuben they were given Bezer, Jahaz, 
06021037	Kedemoth, and Mephaath—four cities, together with their pasturelands. 
06021038	And from the tribe of Gad they were given Ramoth in Gilead, a city of refuge for the manslayer, Mahanaim, 
06021039	Heshbon, and Jazer—four cities in all, together with their pasturelands. 
06021040	In all, twelve cities were allotted to the clans of Merari, the remaining Levite clans. 
06021041	For the Levites, then, there were forty-eight cities in all, together with their pasturelands, within the territory of the Israelites. 
06021042	Each of these cities had its own surrounding pasturelands; this was true for all the cities. 
06021043	Thus the LORD gave Israel all the land He had sworn to give their fathers, and they took possession of it and settled in it. 
06021044	And the LORD gave them rest on every side, just as He had sworn to their fathers. None of their enemies could stand against them, for the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand. 
06021045	Not one of all the LORD’s good promises to the house of Israel had failed; everything was fulfilled. 
06022001	Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh 
06022002	and told them, “You have done all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and you have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you. 
06022003	All this time you have not deserted your brothers, up to this very day, but have kept the charge given you by the LORD your God. 
06022004	And now that the LORD your God has given your brothers rest as He promised them, you may return to your homes in the land that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you across the Jordan. 
06022005	But be very careful to observe the commandment and the law that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you: to love the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways, to keep His commandments, to hold fast to Him, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul.” 
06022006	So Joshua blessed them and sent them on their way, and they went to their homes. 
06022007	(To the half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given land in Bashan, and to the other half Joshua gave land on the west side of the Jordan among their brothers.) When Joshua sent them to their homes he blessed them, 
06022008	saying, “Return to your homes with your great wealth, with immense herds of livestock, with silver, gold, bronze, iron, and very many clothes. Divide with your brothers the spoil of your enemies.” 
06022009	So the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh left the Israelites at Shiloh in the land of Canaan to return to their own land of Gilead, which they had acquired according to the command of the LORD through Moses. 
06022010	And when they came to Geliloth near the Jordan in the land of Canaan, the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an imposing altar there by the Jordan. 
06022011	Then the Israelites received the report: “Behold, the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar on the border of the land of Canaan, at Geliloth near the Jordan on the Israelite side.” 
06022012	And when they heard this, the whole congregation of Israel assembled at Shiloh to go to war against them. 
06022013	The Israelites sent Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest to the land of Gilead, to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. 
06022014	With him they sent ten chiefs—one family leader from each tribe of Israel, each the head of a family among the clans of Israel. 
06022015	They went to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead and said to them, 
06022016	“This is what the whole congregation of the LORD says: ‘What is this breach of faith you have committed today against the God of Israel by turning away from the LORD and building for yourselves an altar, that you might rebel against the LORD this day? 
06022017	Was not the sin of Peor enough for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day? It even brought a plague upon the congregation of the LORD. 
06022018	And now, would you turn away from the LORD? If you rebel today against the LORD, tomorrow He will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel. 
06022019	If indeed the land of your inheritance is unclean, then cross over to the land of the LORD’s possession, where the LORD’s tabernacle stands, and take possession of it among us. But do not rebel against the LORD or against us by building for yourselves an altar other than the altar of the LORD our God. 
06022020	Was not Achan son of Zerah unfaithful regarding what was set apart for destruction, bringing wrath upon the whole congregation of Israel? Yet it was not only Achan who perished because of his sin!’” 
06022021	Then the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered the leaders of the clans of Israel: 
06022022	“The LORD, the Mighty One, is God! The LORD, the Mighty One, is God! He knows, and may Israel also know. If this was in rebellion or breach of faith against the LORD, do not spare us today. 
06022023	If we have built for ourselves an altar to turn away from Him and to offer burnt offerings and grain offerings on it, or to sacrifice peace offerings on it, may the LORD Himself hold us accountable. 
06022024	But in fact we have done this for fear that in the future your descendants might say to ours, ‘What have you to do with the LORD, the God of Israel? 
06022025	For the LORD has made the Jordan a border between us and you Reubenites and Gadites. You have no share in the LORD!’ So your descendants could cause ours to stop fearing the LORD. 
06022026	That is why we said, ‘Let us take action and build an altar for ourselves, but not for burnt offerings or sacrifices. 
06022027	Rather, let it be a witness between us and you and the generations to come, that we will worship the LORD in His presence with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and peace offerings.’ Then in the future, your descendants cannot say to ours, ‘You have no share in the LORD!’ 
06022028	Therefore we said, ‘If they ever say this to us or to our descendants, we will answer: Look at the replica of the altar of the LORD that our fathers made, not for burnt offerings or sacrifices, but as a witness between us and you.’ 
06022029	Far be it from us to rebel against the LORD and turn away from Him today by building an altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings, or sacrifices, other than the altar of the LORD our God, which stands before His tabernacle.” 
06022030	When Phinehas the priest and the chiefs of the congregation—the heads of Israel’s clans who were with him—heard what the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh had to say, they were satisfied. 
06022031	Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest said to the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh, “Today we know that the LORD is among us, because you have not committed this breach of faith against Him. Consequently, you have delivered the Israelites from the hand of the LORD.” 
06022032	Then Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, together with the other leaders, returned to the Israelites in the land of Canaan and brought back a report regarding the Reubenites and Gadites in the land of Gilead. 
06022033	The Israelites were satisfied with the report, and they blessed God and spoke no more about going to war against them to destroy the land where the Reubenites and Gadites lived. 
06022034	So the Reubenites and Gadites named the altar Witness, for they said, “It is a witness between us that the LORD is God.” 
06023001	A long time after the LORD had given Israel rest from all the enemies around them, when Joshua was old and well along in years, 
06023002	he summoned all Israel, including its elders, leaders, judges, and officers. “I am old and well along in years,” he said, 
06023003	“and you have seen everything that the LORD your God has done to all these nations for your sake, because it was the LORD your God who fought for you. 
06023004	See, I have allotted as an inheritance to your tribes these remaining nations, including all the nations I have already cut off, from the Jordan westward to the Great Sea. 
06023005	The LORD your God will push them out of your way and drive them out before you, so that you can take possession of their land, as the LORD your God promised you. 
06023006	Be very strong, then, so that you can keep and obey all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, not turning aside from it to the right or to the left. 
06023007	So you are not to associate with these nations that remain among you. You must not call on the names of their gods or swear by them, and you must not serve them or bow down to them. 
06023008	Instead, you shall hold fast to the LORD your God, as you have done to this day. 
06023009	The LORD has driven out great and powerful nations before you, and to this day no one can stand against you. 
06023010	One of you can put a thousand to flight, because the LORD your God fights for you, just as He promised. 
06023011	Therefore watch yourselves carefully, that you love the LORD your God. 
06023012	For if you turn away and cling to the rest of these nations that remain among you, and if you intermarry and associate with them, 
06023013	know for sure that the LORD your God will no longer drive out these nations before you. Instead, they will become for you a snare and a trap, a scourge in your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land that the LORD your God has given you. 
06023014	Now behold, today I am going the way of all the earth, and you know with all your heart and soul that not one of the good promises the LORD your God made to you has failed. Everything was fulfilled for you; not one promise has failed. 
06023015	But just as every good thing the LORD your God promised you has come to pass, likewise the LORD will bring upon you the calamity He has threatened, until He has destroyed you from this good land He has given you. 
06023016	If you transgress the covenant of the LORD your God, which He commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them, then the anger of the LORD will burn against you, and you will quickly perish from this good land He has given you.” 
06024001	Then Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel at Shechem. He summoned the elders, leaders, judges, and officers of Israel, and they presented themselves before God. 
06024002	And Joshua said to all the people, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Long ago your fathers, including Terah the father of Abraham and Nahor, lived beyond the Euphrates and worshiped other gods. 
06024003	But I took your father Abraham from beyond the Euphrates and led him through all the land of Canaan, and I multiplied his descendants. I gave him Isaac, 
06024004	and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I gave Esau Mount Seir to possess, but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt. 
06024005	Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I afflicted the Egyptians by what I did there, and afterward I brought you out. 
06024006	When I brought your fathers out of Egypt and you reached the Red Sea, the Egyptians pursued them with chariots and horsemen as far as the Red Sea. 
06024007	So your fathers cried out to the LORD, and He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, over whom He brought the sea and engulfed them. Your very eyes saw what I did to the Egyptians. Then you lived in the wilderness for a long time. 
06024008	Later, I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived beyond the Jordan. They fought against you, but I delivered them into your hand, that you should possess their land when I destroyed them before you. 
06024009	Then Balak son of Zippor, the king of Moab, set out to fight against Israel. He sent for Balaam son of Beor to curse you, 
06024010	but I would not listen to Balaam. So he blessed you again and again, and I delivered you from his hand. 
06024011	After this, you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. The people of Jericho fought against you, as did the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites, and Jebusites, and I delivered them into your hand. 
06024012	I sent the hornet ahead of you, and it drove out the two Amorite kings before you, but not by your own sword or bow. 
06024013	So I gave you a land on which you did not toil and cities that you did not build, and now you live in them and eat from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant.’ 
06024014	Now, therefore, fear the LORD and serve Him in sincerity and truth; cast aside the gods your fathers served beyond the Euphrates and in Egypt, and serve the LORD. 
06024015	But if it is unpleasing in your sight to serve the LORD, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your fathers served beyond the Euphrates, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living. As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD!” 
06024016	The people replied, “Far be it from us to forsake the LORD to serve other gods! 
06024017	For the LORD our God brought us and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, and performed these great signs before our eyes. He also protected us throughout our journey and among all the nations through which we traveled. 
06024018	And the LORD drove out before us all the nations, including the Amorites who lived in the land. We too will serve the LORD, because He is our God!” 
06024019	But Joshua said to the people, “You are not able to serve the LORD, for He is a holy God; He is a jealous God; He will not forgive your rebellion or your sins. 
06024020	If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, He will turn and bring disaster on you and consume you, even after He has been good to you.” 
06024021	“No!” replied the people. “We will serve the LORD!” 
06024022	Then Joshua told them, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to serve the LORD.” “We are witnesses!” they said. 
06024023	“Now, therefore,” he said, “get rid of the foreign gods among you and incline your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel.” 
06024024	So the people said to Joshua, “We will serve the LORD our God and obey His voice.” 
06024025	On that day Joshua made a covenant for the people, and there at Shechem he established for them a statute and ordinance. 
06024026	Joshua recorded these things in the Book of the Law of God. Then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak that was near the sanctuary of the LORD. 
06024027	And Joshua said to all the people, “You see this stone. It will be a witness against us, for it has heard all the words the LORD has spoken to us, and it will be a witness against you if you ever deny your God.” 
06024028	Then Joshua sent the people away, each to his own inheritance. 
06024029	Some time later, Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of 110. 
06024030	And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. 
06024031	Israel had served the LORD throughout the days of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had experienced all the works that the LORD had done for Israel. 
06024032	And the bones of Joseph, which the Israelites had brought up out of Egypt, were buried at Shechem in the plot of land that Jacob had purchased from the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of silver. So it became an inheritance for Joseph’s descendants. 
06024033	Eleazar son of Aaron also died, and they buried him at Gibeah, which had been given to his son Phinehas in the hill country of Ephraim. 
07001001	After the death of Joshua, the Israelites inquired of the LORD, “Who will be the first to go up and fight for us against the Canaanites?” 
07001002	“Judah shall go up,” answered the LORD. “Indeed, I have delivered the land into their hands.” 
07001003	Then the men of Judah said to their brothers the Simeonites, “Come up with us to our allotted territory, and let us fight against the Canaanites. And we likewise will go with you to your territory.” So the Simeonites went with them. 
07001004	When Judah attacked, the LORD delivered the Canaanites and Perizzites into their hands, and they struck down ten thousand men at Bezek. 
07001005	And there they found Adoni-bezek and fought against him, striking down the Canaanites and Perizzites. 
07001006	As Adoni-bezek fled, they pursued him, seized him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes. 
07001007	Then Adoni-bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off have gathered the scraps under my table. As I have done to them, so God has repaid me.” And they brought him to Jerusalem, where he died. 
07001008	Then the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it. They put the city to the sword and set it on fire. 
07001009	Afterward, the men of Judah marched down to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country, in the Negev, and in the foothills. 
07001010	Judah also marched against the Canaanites who were living in Hebron (formerly known as Kiriath-arba), and they struck down Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai. 
07001011	From there they marched against the inhabitants of Debir (formerly known as Kiriath-sepher). 
07001012	And Caleb said, “To the man who strikes down Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage.” 
07001013	So Othniel son of Caleb’s younger brother Kenaz captured the city, and Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to him in marriage. 
07001014	One day Acsah came to Othniel and urged him to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What do you desire?” 
07001015	“Give me a blessing,” she answered. “Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me springs of water as well.” So Caleb gave her both the upper and lower springs. 
07001016	Now the descendants of Moses’ father-in-law, the Kenite, went up with the men of Judah from the City of Palms to the Wilderness of Judah in the Negev near Arad. They went to live among the people. 
07001017	Then the men of Judah went with their brothers the Simeonites, attacked the Canaanites living in Zephath, and devoted the city to destruction. So it was called Hormah. 
07001018	And Judah also captured Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron—each with its territory. 
07001019	The LORD was with Judah, and they took possession of the hill country; but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the plains because they had chariots of iron. 
07001020	Just as Moses had promised, Judah gave Hebron to Caleb, who drove out the descendants of the three sons of Anak. 
07001021	The Benjamites, however, failed to drive out the Jebusites living in Jerusalem. So to this day the Jebusites live there among the Benjamites. 
07001022	The house of Joseph also attacked Bethel, and the LORD was with them. 
07001023	They sent spies to Bethel (formerly known as Luz), 
07001024	and when the spies saw a man coming out of the city, they said to him, “Please show us how to get into the city, and we will treat you kindly.” 
07001025	So the man showed them the entrance to the city, and they put the city to the sword but released that man and all his family. 
07001026	And the man went to the land of the Hittites, built a city, and called it Luz, which is its name to this day. 
07001027	At that time Manasseh failed to drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, Megiddo, and their villages; for the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land. 
07001028	When Israel became stronger, they pressed the Canaanites into forced labor, but they never drove them out completely. 
07001029	Ephraim also failed to drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer; so the Canaanites continued to dwell among them in Gezer. 
07001030	Zebulun failed to drive out the inhabitants of Kitron and Nahalol; so the Canaanites lived among them and served as forced laborers. 
07001031	Asher failed to drive out the inhabitants of Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, and Rehob. 
07001032	So the Asherites lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, because they did not drive them out. 
07001033	Naphtali failed to drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath. So the Naphtalites also lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, but the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath served them as forced laborers. 
07001034	The Amorites forced the Danites into the hill country and did not allow them to come down into the plain. 
07001035	And the Amorites were determined to dwell in Mount Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim. But when the house of Joseph grew in strength, they pressed the Amorites into forced labor. 
07001036	And the border of the Amorites extended from the Ascent of Akrabbim to Sela and beyond. 
07002001	Now the angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bochim and said, “I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land that I had promised to your fathers, and I said, ‘I will never break My covenant with you, 
07002002	and you are not to make a covenant with the people of this land, but you shall tear down their altars.’ Yet you have not obeyed My voice. What is this you have done? 
07002003	So now I tell you that I will not drive out these people before you; they will be thorns in your sides, and their gods will be a snare to you.” 
07002004	When the angel of the LORD had spoken these words to all the Israelites, the people lifted up their voices and wept. 
07002005	So they called that place Bochim and offered sacrifices there to the LORD. 
07002006	After Joshua had dismissed the people, the Israelites went out to take possession of the land, each to his own inheritance. 
07002007	And the people served the LORD throughout the days of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him, who had seen all the great works that the LORD had done for Israel. 
07002008	And Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of 110. 
07002009	They buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath-heres in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. 
07002010	After that whole generation had also been gathered to their fathers, another generation rose up who did not know the LORD or the works that He had done for Israel. 
07002011	And the Israelites did evil in the sight of the LORD and served the Baals. 
07002012	Thus they forsook the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, and they followed after various gods of the peoples around them. They bowed down to them and provoked the LORD to anger, 
07002013	for they forsook Him and served Baal and the Ashtoreths. 
07002014	Then the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He delivered them into the hands of those who plundered them. He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, whom they were no longer able to resist. 
07002015	Wherever Israel marched out, the hand of the LORD was against them to bring calamity, just as He had sworn to them. So they were greatly distressed. 
07002016	Then the LORD raised up judges, who saved them from the hands of those who plundered them. 
07002017	Israel, however, did not listen to their judges. Instead, they prostituted themselves with other gods and bowed down to them. They quickly turned from the way of their fathers, who had walked in obedience to the LORD’s commandments; they did not do as their fathers had done. 
07002018	Whenever the LORD raised up a judge for the Israelites, He was with that judge and saved them from the hands of their enemies while the judge was still alive; for the LORD was moved to pity by their groaning under those who oppressed them and afflicted them. 
07002019	But when the judge died, the Israelites became even more corrupt than their fathers, going after other gods to serve them and bow down to them. They would not give up their evil practices and stubborn ways. 
07002020	So the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He said, “Because this nation has transgressed the covenant I laid down for their fathers and has not heeded My voice, 
07002021	I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations Joshua left when he died. 
07002022	In this way I will test whether Israel will keep the way of the LORD by walking in it as their fathers did.” 
07002023	That is why the LORD had left those nations in place and had not driven them out immediately by delivering them into the hand of Joshua. 
07003001	These are the nations that the LORD left to test all the Israelites who had not known any of the wars in Canaan, 
07003002	if only to teach warfare to the subsequent generations of Israel, especially to those who had not known it formerly: 
07003003	the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived in the mountains of Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon to Lebo-hamath. 
07003004	These nations were left to test the Israelites, to find out whether they would keep the commandments of the LORD, which He had given their fathers through Moses. 
07003005	Thus the Israelites continued to live among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 
07003006	And they took the daughters of these people in marriage, gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods. 
07003007	So the Israelites did evil in the sight of the LORD; they forgot the LORD their God and served the Baals and the Asherahs. 
07003008	Then the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Aram-naharaim, and the Israelites served him eight years. 
07003009	But when the Israelites cried out to the LORD, He raised up Othniel son of Caleb’s younger brother Kenaz as a deliverer to save them. 
07003010	The Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he became Israel’s judge and went out to war. And the LORD delivered Cushan-rishathaim king of Aram into the hand of Othniel, who prevailed against him. 
07003011	So the land had rest for forty years, until Othniel son of Kenaz died. 
07003012	Once again the Israelites did evil in the sight of the LORD. So He gave Eglon king of Moab power over Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD. 
07003013	After enlisting the Ammonites and Amalekites to join forces with him, Eglon attacked and defeated Israel, taking possession of the City of Palms. 
07003014	The Israelites served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years. 
07003015	And again they cried out to the LORD, and He raised up Ehud son of Gera, a left-handed Benjamite, as their deliverer. So they sent him with tribute to Eglon king of Moab. 
07003016	Now Ehud had made for himself a double-edged sword a cubit long. He strapped it to his right thigh under his cloak 
07003017	and brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab, who was an obese man. 
07003018	After Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he ushered out those who had carried it. 
07003019	But upon reaching the idols near Gilgal, he himself turned back and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” “Silence,” said the king, and all his attendants left him. 
07003020	Then Ehud approached him while he was sitting alone in the coolness of his upper room. “I have a word from God for you,” Ehud said, and the king rose from his seat. 
07003021	And Ehud reached with his left hand, pulled the sword from his right thigh, and plunged it into Eglon’s belly. 
07003022	Even the handle sank in after the blade, and Eglon’s fat closed in over it, so that Ehud did not withdraw the sword from his belly. And Eglon’s bowels emptied. 
07003023	Then Ehud went out through the porch, closing and locking the doors of the upper room behind him. 
07003024	After Ehud was gone, Eglon’s servants came in and found the doors of the upper room locked. “He must be relieving himself in the cool room,” they said. 
07003025	So they waited until they became worried and saw that he had still not opened the doors of the upper room. Then they took the key and opened the doors—and there was their lord lying dead on the floor. 
07003026	Ehud, however, had escaped while the servants waited. He passed by the idols and escaped to Seirah. 
07003027	On arriving in Seirah, he blew the ram’s horn throughout the hill country of Ephraim. The Israelites came down with him from the hills, and he became their leader. 
07003028	“Follow me,” he told them, “for the LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.” So they followed him down and seized the fords of the Jordan leading to Moab, and they did not allow anyone to cross over. 
07003029	At that time they struck down about ten thousand Moabites, all robust and valiant men. Not one of them escaped. 
07003030	So Moab was subdued under the hand of Israel that day, and the land had rest for eighty years. 
07003031	After Ehud came Shamgar son of Anath. And he too saved Israel, striking down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad. 
07004001	After Ehud died, the Israelites again did evil in the sight of the LORD. 
07004002	So the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his forces was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-hagoyim. 
07004003	Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD, because Jabin had nine hundred chariots of iron, and he had harshly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years. 
07004004	Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time. 
07004005	And she would sit under the Palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, where the Israelites would go up to her for judgment. 
07004006	She summoned Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him, “Surely the LORD, the God of Israel, is commanding you: ‘Go and march to Mount Tabor, taking with you ten thousand men of Naphtali and Zebulun. 
07004007	And I will draw out Sisera the commander of Jabin’s army, his chariots, and his troops to the River Kishon, and I will deliver him into your hand.’” 
07004008	Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.” 
07004009	“I will certainly go with you,” Deborah replied, “but the road you are taking will bring you no honor, because the LORD will be selling Sisera into the hand of a woman.” So Deborah got up and went with Barak to Kedesh, 
07004010	where he summoned Zebulun and Naphtali. Ten thousand men followed him, and Deborah also went with him. 
07004011	Now Heber the Kenite had moved away from the Kenites, the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent by the great tree of Zaanannim, which was near Kedesh. 
07004012	When Sisera was told that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up Mount Tabor, 
07004013	he summoned all nine hundred of his iron chariots and all the men with him, from Harosheth-hagoyim to the River Kishon. 
07004014	Then Deborah said to Barak, “Arise, for this is the day that the LORD has delivered Sisera into your hand. Has not the LORD gone before you?” So Barak came down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him. 
07004015	And in front of him the LORD routed with the sword Sisera, all his charioteers, and all his army. Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot. 
07004016	Then Barak pursued the chariots and army as far as Harosheth-hagoyim, and the whole army of Sisera fell by the sword; not a single man was left. 
07004017	Meanwhile, Sisera had fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. 
07004018	Jael went out to greet Sisera and said to him, “Come in, my lord. Come in with me. Do not be afraid.” So he entered her tent, and she covered him with a blanket. 
07004019	Sisera said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.” So she opened a container of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him again. 
07004020	“Stand at the entrance to the tent,” he said, “and if anyone comes and asks you, ‘Is there a man here?’ say, ‘No.’” 
07004021	But as he lay sleeping from exhaustion, Heber’s wife Jael took a tent peg, grabbed a hammer, and went silently to Sisera. She drove the peg through his temple and into the ground, and he died. 
07004022	When Barak arrived in pursuit of Sisera, Jael went out to greet him and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man you are seeking.” So he went in with her, and there lay Sisera dead, with a tent peg through his temple. 
07004023	On that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan before the Israelites. 
07004024	And the hand of the Israelites grew stronger and stronger against Jabin king of Canaan until they destroyed him. 
07005001	On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song: 
07005002	“When the princes take the lead in Israel, when the people volunteer, bless the LORD. 
07005003	Listen, O kings! Give ear, O princes! I will sing to the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD, the God of Israel. 
07005004	O LORD, when You went out from Seir, when You marched from the land of Edom, the earth trembled, the heavens poured out rain, and the clouds poured down water. 
07005005	The mountains quaked before the LORD, the One of Sinai, before the LORD, the God of Israel. 
07005006	In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were deserted and the travelers took the byways. 
07005007	Life in the villages ceased; it ended in Israel, until I, Deborah, arose, a mother in Israel. 
07005008	When they chose new gods, then war came to their gates. Not a shield or spear was found among forty thousand in Israel. 
07005009	My heart is with the princes of Israel, with the volunteers among the people. Bless the LORD! 
07005010	You who ride white donkeys, who sit on saddle blankets, and you who travel the road, ponder 
07005011	the voices of the singers at the watering places. There they shall recount the righteous acts of the LORD, the righteous deeds of His villagers in Israel. Then the people of the LORD went down to the gates: 
07005012	‘Awake, awake, O Deborah! Awake, awake, sing a song! Arise, O Barak, and take hold of your captives, O son of Abinoam!’ 
07005013	Then the survivors came down to the nobles; the people of the LORD came down to me against the mighty. 
07005014	Some came from Ephraim, with their roots in Amalek; Benjamin came with your people after you. The commanders came down from Machir, the bearers of the marshal’s staff from Zebulun. 
07005015	The princes of Issachar were with Deborah, and Issachar was with Barak, rushing into the valley at his heels. In the clans of Reuben there was great indecision. 
07005016	Why did you sit among the sheepfolds to hear the whistling for the flocks? In the clans of Reuben there was great indecision. 
07005017	Gilead remained beyond the Jordan. Dan, why did you linger by the ships? Asher stayed at the coast and remained in his harbors. 
07005018	Zebulun was a people who risked their lives; Naphtali, too, on the heights of the battlefield. 
07005019	Kings came and fought; then the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo, but they took no plunder of silver. 
07005020	From the heavens the stars fought; from their courses they fought against Sisera. 
07005021	The River Kishon swept them away, the ancient river, the River Kishon. March on, O my soul, in strength! 
07005022	Then the hooves of horses thundered— the mad galloping of his stallions. 
07005023	‘Curse Meroz,’ says the angel of the LORD. ‘Bitterly curse her inhabitants; for they did not come to help the LORD, to help the LORD against the mighty.’ 
07005024	Most blessed among women is Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, most blessed of tent-dwelling women. 
07005025	He asked for water, and she gave him milk. In a magnificent bowl she brought him curds. 
07005026	She reached for the tent peg, her right hand for the workman’s hammer. She struck Sisera and crushed his skull; she shattered and pierced his temple. 
07005027	At her feet he collapsed, he fell, there he lay still; at her feet he collapsed, he fell; where he collapsed, there he fell dead. 
07005028	Sisera’s mother looked through the window; she peered through the lattice and lamented: ‘Why is his chariot so long in coming? What has delayed the clatter of his chariots?’ 
07005029	Her wisest ladies answer; indeed she keeps telling herself, 
07005030	‘Are they not finding and dividing the spoil— a girl or two for each warrior, a plunder of dyed garments for Sisera, the spoil of embroidered garments for the neck of the looter?’ 
07005031	So may all Your enemies perish, O LORD! But may those who love You shine like the sun at its brightest.” And the land had rest for forty years. 
07006001	Again the Israelites did evil in the sight of the LORD; so He delivered them into the hand of Midian for seven years, 
07006002	and the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of the Midianites, the Israelites prepared shelters for themselves in the mountains, caves, and strongholds. 
07006003	Whenever the Israelites planted their crops, the Midianites, Amalekites, and other people of the east would come up and invade them, 
07006004	encamping against them as far as Gaza and destroying the produce of the land. They left Israel with no sustenance, neither sheep nor oxen nor donkeys. 
07006005	For the Midianites came with their livestock and their tents like a great swarm of locusts. They and their camels were innumerable, and they entered the land to ravage it. 
07006006	Israel was greatly impoverished by Midian, and the Israelites cried out to the LORD. 
07006007	Now when the Israelites cried out to the LORD because of Midian, 
07006008	He sent them a prophet, who told them, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I brought you up out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. 
07006009	I delivered you out of the hands of Egypt and all your oppressors. I drove them out before you and gave you their land. 
07006010	And I said to you: ‘I am the LORD your God. You must not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.’ But you did not obey Me.” 
07006011	Then the angel of the LORD came and sat down under the oak in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to hide it from the Midianites. 
07006012	And the angel of the LORD appeared to Gideon and said, “The LORD is with you, O mighty man of valor.” 
07006013	“Please, my Lord,” Gideon replied, “if the LORD is with us, why has all this happened to us? And where are all His wonders of which our fathers told us, saying, ‘Has not the LORD brought us up out of Egypt?’ But now the LORD has forsaken us and delivered us into the hand of Midian.” 
07006014	The LORD turned to him and said, “Go in the strength you have and save Israel from the hand of Midian. Am I not sending you?” 
07006015	“Please, my Lord,” Gideon replied, “how can I save Israel? Indeed, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the youngest in my father’s house.” 
07006016	“Surely I will be with you,” the LORD replied, “and you will strike down all the Midianites as one man.” 
07006017	Gideon answered, “If I have found favor in Your sight, give me a sign that it is You speaking with me. 
07006018	Please do not depart from this place until I return to You. Let me bring my offering and set it before You.” And the LORD said, “I will stay until you return.” 
07006019	So Gideon went in and prepared a young goat and unleavened bread and an ephah of flour. He placed the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot and brought them out to present to Him under the oak. 
07006020	And the angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened bread, lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth.” And Gideon did so. 
07006021	Then the angel of the LORD extended the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened bread. And fire flared from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread. Then the angel of the LORD vanished from his sight. 
07006022	When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the LORD, he said, “Oh no, Lord GOD! I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face!” 
07006023	But the LORD said to him, “Peace be with you. Do not be afraid, for you will not die.” 
07006024	So Gideon built an altar to the LORD there and called it The LORD Is Peace. To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. 
07006025	On that very night the LORD said to Gideon, “Take your father’s young bull and a second bull seven years old, tear down your father’s altar to Baal, and cut down the Asherah pole beside it. 
07006026	Then build a proper altar to the LORD your God on the top of this stronghold. And with the wood of the Asherah pole you cut down, take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering.” 
07006027	So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the LORD had told him. But because he was too afraid of his father’s household and the men of the city, he did it by night rather than in the daytime. 
07006028	When the men of the city got up in the morning, there was Baal’s altar torn down, with the Asherah pole cut down beside it and the second bull offered up on the newly built altar. 
07006029	“Who did this?” they said to one another. And after they had investigated thoroughly, they were told, “Gideon son of Joash did it.” 
07006030	Then the men of the city said to Joash, “Bring out your son. He must die, because he has torn down Baal’s altar and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.” 
07006031	But Joash said to all who stood against him, “Are you contending for Baal? Are you trying to save him? Whoever pleads his case will be put to death by morning! If Baal is a god, let him contend for himself with the one who has torn down his altar.” 
07006032	So on that day Gideon was called Jerubbaal, that is to say, “Let Baal contend with him,” because he had torn down Baal’s altar. 
07006033	Then all the Midianites, Amalekites, and other people of the east gathered together, crossed over the Jordan, and camped in the Valley of Jezreel. 
07006034	So the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, who blew the ram’s horn and rallied the Abiezrites behind him. 
07006035	Calling them to arms, Gideon sent messengers throughout Manasseh, as well as Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, so that they came up to meet him. 
07006036	Then Gideon said to God, “If You are going to save Israel by my hand, as You have said, 
07006037	then behold, I will place a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry, then I will know that You are going to save Israel by my hand, as You have said.” 
07006038	And that is what happened. When Gideon arose the next morning, he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew—a bowlful of water. 
07006039	Then Gideon said to God, “Do not be angry with me; let me speak one more time. Please allow me one more test with the fleece. This time let it be dry, and the ground covered with dew.” 
07006040	And that night God did so. Only the fleece was dry, and dew covered the ground. 
07007001	Early in the morning Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the men with him camped beside the spring of Harod. And the camp of Midian was north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh. 
07007002	Then the LORD said to Gideon, “You have too many men for Me to deliver Midian into their hands, lest Israel glorify themselves over Me, saying, ‘My own hand has saved me.’ 
07007003	Now, therefore, proclaim in the hearing of the men: ‘Whoever is fearful and trembling may turn back and leave Mount Gilead.’” So twenty-two thousand of them turned back, but ten thousand remained. 
07007004	Then the LORD said to Gideon, “There are still too many men. Take them down to the water, and I will sift them for you there. If I say to you, ‘This one shall go with you,’ he shall go. But if I say, ‘This one shall not go with you,’ he shall not go.” 
07007005	So Gideon brought the men down to the water, and the LORD said to him, “Separate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel to drink.” 
07007006	And the number of those who lapped the water with their hands to their mouths was three hundred men; all the others knelt to drink. 
07007007	Then the LORD said to Gideon, “With the three hundred men who lapped the water I will save you and deliver the Midianites into your hand. But all the others are to go home.” 
07007008	So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites to their tents but kept the three hundred men, who took charge of the provisions and rams’ horns of the others. And the camp of Midian lay below him in the valley. 
07007009	That night the LORD said to Gideon, “Get up and go down against the camp, for I have delivered it into your hand. 
07007010	But if you are afraid to do so, then go down to the camp with your servant Purah 
07007011	and listen to what they are saying. Then your hands will be strengthened to attack the camp.” So he went with Purah his servant to the outposts where armed men were guarding the camp. 
07007012	Now the Midianites, Amalekites, and all the other people of the east had settled in the valley like a swarm of locusts, and their camels were as countless as the sand on the seashore. 
07007013	And as Gideon arrived, a man was telling his friend about a dream. “Behold, I had a dream,” he said, “and I saw a loaf of barley bread come tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent so hard that the tent overturned and collapsed.” 
07007014	His friend replied: “This is nothing less than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has delivered Midian and the whole camp into his hand.” 
07007015	When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he bowed in worship. He returned to the camp of Israel and said, “Get up, for the LORD has delivered the camp of Midian into your hand.” 
07007016	And he divided the three hundred men into three companies and gave each man a ram’s horn in one hand and a large jar in the other, containing a torch. 
07007017	“Watch me and do as I do,” Gideon said. “When I come to the outskirts of the camp, do exactly as I do. 
07007018	When I and all who are with me blow our horns, then you are also to blow your horns from all around the camp and shout, ‘For the LORD and for Gideon!’” 
07007019	Gideon and the hundred men with him reached the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just after the changing of the guard. They blew their horns and broke the jars that were in their hands. 
07007020	The three companies blew their horns and shattered their jars. Holding the torches in their left hands and the horns in their right hands, they shouted, “A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!” 
07007021	Each Israelite took his position around the camp, and the entire Midianite army fled, crying out as they ran. 
07007022	And when the three hundred rams’ horns sounded, the LORD set all the men in the camp against one another with their swords. The army fled to Beth-shittah toward Zererah as far as the border of Abel-meholah near Tabbath. 
07007023	Then the men of Israel were called out from Naphtali, Asher, and all Manasseh, and they pursued the Midianites. 
07007024	Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim to say, “Come down against the Midianites and seize the waters of the Jordan ahead of them as far as Beth-barah.” So all the men of Ephraim were called out, and they captured the waters of the Jordan as far as Beth-barah. 
07007025	They also captured Oreb and Zeeb, the two princes of Midian; and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. So they pursued the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of the Jordan. 
07008001	Then the men of Ephraim said to Gideon, “Why have you done this to us? Why did you fail to call us when you went to fight against Midian?” And they contended with him violently. 
07008002	But Gideon answered them, “Now what have I accomplished compared to you? Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the grape harvest of Abiezer? 
07008003	God has delivered Oreb and Zeeb, the two princes of Midian, into your hand. What was I able to do compared to you?” When he had said this, their anger against him subsided. 
07008004	Then Gideon and his three hundred men came to the Jordan and crossed it, exhausted yet still in pursuit. 
07008005	So Gideon said to the men of Succoth, “Please give my troops some bread, for they are exhausted, and I am still pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.” 
07008006	But the leaders of Succoth asked, “Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your possession, that we should give bread to your army?” 
07008007	“Very well,” Gideon replied, “when the LORD has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will tear your flesh with the thorns and briers of the wilderness!” 
07008008	From there he went up to Penuel and asked the same from them, but the men of Penuel gave the same response as the men of Succoth. 
07008009	So Gideon told the men of Penuel, “When I return in triumph, I will tear down this tower!” 
07008010	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their army of about fifteen thousand men—all that were left of the armies of the people of the east. A hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had already fallen. 
07008011	And Gideon went up by way of the caravan route east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and he attacked their army, taking them by surprise. 
07008012	When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, Gideon pursued and captured these two kings of Midian, routing their entire army. 
07008013	After this, Gideon son of Joash returned from the battle along the Ascent of Heres. 
07008014	There he captured a young man of Succoth and interrogated him. The young man wrote down for him the names of the seventy-seven leaders and elders of Succoth. 
07008015	And Gideon went to the men of Succoth and said, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me, saying, ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your possession, that we should give bread to your weary men?’” 
07008016	Then he took the elders of the city, and using the thorns and briers of the wilderness, he disciplined the men of Succoth. 
07008017	He also pulled down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city. 
07008018	Next, Gideon asked Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?” “Men like you,” they answered, “each one resembling the son of a king.” 
07008019	“They were my brothers,” Gideon replied, “the sons of my mother! As surely as the LORD lives, if you had let them live, I would not kill you.” 
07008020	So he said to Jether, his firstborn, “Get up and kill them.” But the young man did not draw his sword; he was fearful because he was still a youth. 
07008021	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Get up and kill us yourself, for as the man is, so is his strength.” So Gideon got up and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the crescent ornaments from the necks of their camels. 
07008022	Then the Israelites said to Gideon, “Rule over us—you and your son and grandson—for you have saved us from the hand of Midian.” 
07008023	But Gideon replied, “I will not rule over you, nor will my son. The LORD shall rule over you.” 
07008024	Then he added, “Let me make a request of you, that each of you give me an earring from his plunder.” (For the enemies had gold earrings because they were Ishmaelites.) 
07008025	“We will give them gladly,” they replied. So they spread out a garment, and each man threw an earring from his plunder onto it. 
07008026	The weight of the gold earrings he had requested was 1,700 shekels, in addition to the crescent ornaments, the pendants, the purple garments of the kings of Midian, and the chains from the necks of their camels. 
07008027	From all this Gideon made an ephod, which he placed in Ophrah, his hometown. But soon all Israel prostituted themselves by worshiping it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his household. 
07008028	In this way Midian was subdued before the Israelites and did not raise its head again. So the land had rest for forty years in the days of Gideon, 
07008029	and he—Jerubbaal son of Joash—returned home and settled down. 
07008030	Gideon had seventy sons of his own, since he had many wives. 
07008031	His concubine, who dwelt in Shechem, also bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech. 
07008032	Later, Gideon son of Joash died at a ripe old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. 
07008033	And as soon as Gideon was dead, the Israelites turned and prostituted themselves with the Baals, and they set up Baal-berith as their god. 
07008034	The Israelites failed to remember the LORD their God who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side. 
07008035	They did not show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) for all the good things he had done for Israel. 
07009001	Now Abimelech son of Jerubbaal went to his mother’s brothers at Shechem and said to them and to all the clan of his mother, 
07009002	“Please ask all the leaders of Shechem, ‘Is it better for you that seventy men, all the sons of Jerubbaal, rule over you, or just one man?’ Remember that I am your own flesh and blood.” 
07009003	And when his mother’s brothers spoke all these words about him in the presence of all the leaders of Shechem, their hearts were inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, “He is our brother.” 
07009004	So they gave him seventy shekels of silver from the temple of Baal-berith, with which Abimelech hired some worthless and reckless men to follow him. 
07009005	He went to his father’s house in Ophrah, and on one stone murdered his seventy brothers, the sons of Jerubbaal. But Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, survived, because he hid himself. 
07009006	Then all the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo gathered beside the oak at the pillar in Shechem and proceeded to make Abimelech their king. 
07009007	When this was reported to Jotham, he climbed to the top of Mount Gerizim, raised his voice, and cried out: “Listen to me, O leaders of Shechem, and may God listen to you. 
07009008	One day the trees set out to anoint a king for themselves. They said to the olive tree, ‘Reign over us.’ 
07009009	But the olive tree replied, ‘Should I stop giving my oil that honors both God and man, to hold sway over the trees?’ 
07009010	Then the trees said to the fig tree, ‘Come and reign over us.’ 
07009011	But the fig tree replied, ‘Should I stop giving my sweetness and my good fruit, to hold sway over the trees?’ 
07009012	Then the trees said to the grapevine, ‘Come and reign over us.’ 
07009013	But the grapevine replied, ‘Should I stop giving my wine that cheers both God and man, to hold sway over the trees?’ 
07009014	Finally all the trees said to the thornbush, ‘Come and reign over us.’ 
07009015	But the thornbush replied, ‘If you really are anointing me as king over you, come and find refuge in my shade. But if not, may fire come out of the thornbush and consume the cedars of Lebanon.’ 
07009016	Now if you have acted faithfully and honestly in making Abimelech king, if you have done well by Jerubbaal and his family, and if you have done to him as he deserves— 
07009017	for my father fought for you and risked his life to deliver you from the hand of Midian, 
07009018	but you have risen up against my father’s house this day and killed his seventy sons on a single stone, and you have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the leaders of Shechem because he is your brother— 
07009019	if you have acted faithfully and honestly toward Jerubbaal and his house this day, then may you rejoice in Abimelech, and he in you. 
07009020	But if not, may fire come from Abimelech and consume the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo, and may fire come from the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo and consume Abimelech.” 
07009021	Then Jotham ran away, escaping to Beer, and he lived there for fear of his brother Abimelech. 
07009022	After Abimelech had reigned over Israel for three years, 
07009023	God sent a spirit of animosity between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem and caused them to treat Abimelech deceitfully, 
07009024	in order that the crime against the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come to justice and their blood be avenged on their brother Abimelech and on the leaders of Shechem, who had helped him murder his brothers. 
07009025	The leaders of Shechem set up an ambush against Abimelech on the hilltops, and they robbed all who passed by them on the road. So this was reported to Abimelech. 
07009026	Meanwhile, Gaal son of Ebed came with his brothers and crossed into Shechem, and the leaders of Shechem put their confidence in him. 
07009027	And after they had gone out into the fields, gathered grapes from their vineyards, and trodden them, they held a festival and went into the house of their god; and as they ate and drank, they cursed Abimelech. 
07009028	Then Gaal son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and is not Zebul his officer? You are to serve the men of Hamor, the father of Shechem. Why should we serve Abimelech? 
07009029	If only this people were under my authority, I would remove Abimelech; I would say to him, ‘Muster your army and come out!’” 
07009030	When Zebul the governor of the city heard the words of Gaal son of Ebed, he burned with anger. 
07009031	So he covertly sent messengers to Abimelech to say, “Look, Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem and are stirring up the city against you. 
07009032	Now then, tonight you and the people with you are to come and lie in wait in the fields. 
07009033	And in the morning at sunrise, get up and advance against the city. When Gaal and his men come out against you, do to them whatever you are able.” 
07009034	So Abimelech and all his troops set out by night and lay in wait against Shechem in four companies. 
07009035	Now Gaal son of Ebed went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate just as Abimelech and his men came out from their hiding places. 
07009036	When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Look, people are coming down from the mountains!” But Zebul replied, “The shadows of the mountains look like men to you.” 
07009037	Then Gaal spoke up again, “Look, people are coming down from the center of the land, and one company is coming by way of the Diviners’ Oak.” 
07009038	“Where is your gloating now?” Zebul replied. “You said, ‘Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?’ Are these not the people you ridiculed? Go out now and fight them!” 
07009039	So Gaal went out before the leaders of Shechem and fought against Abimelech, 
07009040	but Abimelech pursued him, and Gaal fled before him. And many Shechemites fell wounded all the way to the entrance of the gate. 
07009041	Abimelech stayed in Arumah, and Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers out of Shechem. 
07009042	The next day the people of Shechem went out into the fields, and this was reported to Abimelech. 
07009043	So he took his men, divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the fields. When he saw the people coming out of the city, he rose up against them and attacked them. 
07009044	Then Abimelech and the companies with him rushed forward and took their stand at the entrance of the city gate. The other two companies rushed against all who were in the fields and struck them down. 
07009045	And all that day Abimelech fought against the city until he had captured it and killed its people. Then he demolished the city and sowed it with salt. 
07009046	On hearing of this, all the leaders in the tower of Shechem entered the inner chamber of the temple of El-berith. 
07009047	And when Abimelech was told that all the leaders in the tower of Shechem were gathered there, 
07009048	he and all his men went up to Mount Zalmon. Abimelech took his axe in his hand and cut a branch from the trees, which he lifted to his shoulder, saying to his men, “Hurry and do what you have seen me do.” 
07009049	So each man also cut his own branch and followed Abimelech. Then they piled the branches against the inner chamber and set it on fire above them, killing everyone in the tower of Shechem, about a thousand men and women. 
07009050	Then Abimelech went to Thebez, encamped against it, and captured it. 
07009051	But there was a strong tower inside the city, and all the men, women, and leaders of the city fled there. They locked themselves in and went up to the roof of the tower. 
07009052	When Abimelech came to attack the tower, he approached its entrance to set it on fire. 
07009053	But a woman dropped an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head, crushing his skull. 
07009054	He quickly called his armor-bearer, saying, “Draw your sword and kill me, lest they say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’” So Abimelech’s armor-bearer ran his sword through him, and he died. 
07009055	And when the Israelites saw that Abimelech was dead, they all went home. 
07009056	In this way God repaid the wickedness that Abimelech had done to his father in murdering his seventy brothers. 
07009057	And God also brought all the wickedness of the men of Shechem back upon their own heads. So the curse of Jotham son of Jerubbaal came upon them. 
07010001	After the time of Abimelech, a man of Issachar, Tola son of Puah, the son of Dodo, rose up to save Israel. He lived in Shamir, in the hill country of Ephraim. 
07010002	Tola judged Israel twenty-three years, and when he died, he was buried in Shamir. 
07010003	Tola was followed by Jair the Gileadite, who judged Israel twenty-two years. 
07010004	He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys. And they had thirty towns in the land of Gilead, which to this day are called Havvoth-jair. 
07010005	When Jair died, he was buried in Kamon. 
07010006	And again the Israelites did evil in the sight of the LORD. They served the Baals, the Ashtoreths, the gods of Aram, Sidon, and Moab, and the gods of the Ammonites and Philistines. Thus they forsook the LORD and did not serve Him. 
07010007	So the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and Ammonites, 
07010008	who that very year harassed and oppressed the Israelites, and they did so for eighteen years to all the Israelites on the other side of the Jordan in Gilead, the land of the Amorites. 
07010009	The Ammonites also crossed the Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin, and the house of Ephraim, and Israel was in deep distress. 
07010010	Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD, saying, “We have sinned against You, for we have indeed forsaken our God and served the Baals.” 
07010011	The LORD replied, “When the Egyptians, Amorites, Ammonites, Philistines, 
07010012	Sidonians, Amalekites, and Maonites oppressed you and you cried out to Me, did I not save you from their hands? 
07010013	But you have forsaken Me and served other gods, so I will no longer save you. 
07010014	Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen. Let them save you in your time of trouble.” 
07010015	“We have sinned,” the Israelites said to the LORD. “Deal with us as You see fit; but please deliver us today!” 
07010016	So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the LORD, and He could no longer bear the misery of Israel. 
07010017	Then the Ammonites were called to arms and camped in Gilead, and the Israelites assembled and camped at Mizpah. 
07010018	And the rulers of Gilead said to one another, “Whoever will launch the attack against the Ammonites will be the head of all who live in Gilead.” 
07011001	Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor; he was the son of a prostitute, and Gilead was his father. 
07011002	And Gilead’s wife bore him sons who grew up, drove Jephthah out, and said to him, “You shall have no inheritance in our father’s house, because you are the son of another woman.” 
07011003	So Jephthah fled from his brothers and settled in the land of Tob, where worthless men gathered around him and traveled with him. 
07011004	Some time later, when the Ammonites fought against Israel 
07011005	and made war with them, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob. 
07011006	“Come,” they said, “be our commander, so that we can fight against the Ammonites.” 
07011007	Jephthah replied to the elders of Gilead, “Did you not hate me and expel me from my father’s house? Why then have you come to me now, when you are in distress?” 
07011008	They answered Jephthah, “This is why we now turn to you, that you may go with us, fight the Ammonites, and become leader over all of us who live in Gilead.” 
07011009	But Jephthah asked them, “If you take me back to fight the Ammonites and the LORD gives them to me, will I really be your leader?” 
07011010	And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “The LORD is our witness if we do not do as you say.” 
07011011	So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him their leader and commander. And Jephthah repeated all his terms in the presence of the LORD at Mizpah. 
07011012	Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites, saying, “What do you have against me that you have come to fight against my land?” 
07011013	The king of the Ammonites answered Jephthah’s messengers, “When Israel came up out of Egypt, they seized my land, from the Arnon to the Jabbok and all the way to the Jordan. Now, therefore, restore it peaceably.” 
07011014	Jephthah again sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites 
07011015	to tell him, “This is what Jephthah says: Israel did not take away the land of Moab or of the Ammonites. 
07011016	But when Israel came up out of Egypt, they traveled through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh. 
07011017	Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, ‘Please let us pass through your land,’ but the king of Edom would not listen. They also sent messengers to the king of Moab, but he would not consent. So Israel stayed in Kadesh. 
07011018	Then Israel traveled through the wilderness and bypassed the lands of Edom and Moab. They came to the east side of the land of Moab and camped on the other side of the Arnon. But they did not enter the territory of Moab, since the Arnon was its border. 
07011019	And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, and said to him, ‘Please let us pass through your land into our own place.’ 
07011020	But Sihon would not trust Israel to pass through his territory. So he gathered all his people, encamped in Jahaz, and fought with Israel. 
07011021	Then the LORD, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, who defeated them. So Israel took possession of all the land of the Amorites who inhabited that country, 
07011022	seizing all the land from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan. 
07011023	Now since the LORD, the God of Israel, has driven out the Amorites from before His people Israel, should you now possess it? 
07011024	Do you not possess whatever your god Chemosh grants you? So also, we possess whatever the LORD our God has granted us. 
07011025	Are you now so much better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever contend with Israel or fight against them? 
07011026	For three hundred years Israel has lived in Heshbon, Aroer, and their villages, as well as all the cities along the banks of the Arnon. Why did you not take them back during that time? 
07011027	I have not sinned against you, but you have done me wrong by waging war against me. May the LORD, the Judge, decide today between the Israelites and the Ammonites.” 
07011028	But the king of the Ammonites paid no heed to the message Jephthah sent him. 
07011029	Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh, then through Mizpah of Gilead. And from there he advanced against the Ammonites. 
07011030	Jephthah made this vow to the LORD: “If indeed You will deliver the Ammonites into my hand, 
07011031	then whatever comes out the door of my house to greet me on my triumphant return from the Ammonites will belong to the LORD, and I will offer it up as a burnt offering.” 
07011032	So Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites to fight against them, and the LORD delivered them into his hand. 
07011033	With a great blow he devastated twenty cities from Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith, as far as Abel-keramim. So the Ammonites were subdued before the Israelites. 
07011034	And when Jephthah returned home to Mizpah, there was his daughter coming out to meet him with tambourines and dancing! She was his only child; he had no son or daughter besides her. 
07011035	As soon as Jephthah saw her, he tore his clothes and said, “No! Not my daughter! You have brought me to my knees! You have brought great misery upon me, for I have given my word to the LORD and cannot take it back.” 
07011036	“My father,” she replied, “you have given your word to the LORD. Do to me as you have said, for the LORD has avenged you of your enemies, the Ammonites.” 
07011037	She also said to her father, “Let me do this one thing: Let me wander for two months through the mountains with my friends and mourn my virginity.” 
07011038	“Go,” he said. And he sent her away for two months. So she left with her friends and mourned her virginity upon the mountains. 
07011039	After two months, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed. And she had never had relations with a man. So it has become a custom in Israel 
07011040	that each year the young women of Israel go out for four days to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite. 
07012001	Then the men of Ephraim assembled and crossed the Jordan to Zaphon. They said to Jephthah, “Why have you crossed over to fight the Ammonites without calling us to go with you? We will burn your house down with you inside!” 
07012002	But Jephthah replied, “My people and I had a serious conflict with the Ammonites, and when I called, you did not save me out of their hands. 
07012003	When I saw that you would not save me, I risked my life and crossed over to the Ammonites, and the LORD delivered them into my hand. Why then have you come today to fight against me?” 
07012004	Jephthah then gathered all the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. And the men of Gilead struck them down because the Ephraimites had said, “You Gileadites are fugitives in Ephraim, living in the territories of Ephraim and Manasseh.” 
07012005	The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan leading to Ephraim, and whenever a fugitive from Ephraim would say, “Let me cross over,” the Gileadites would ask him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he answered, “No,” 
07012006	they told him, “Please say Shibboleth.” If he said, “Sibboleth,” because he could not pronounce it correctly, they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. So at that time 42,000 Ephraimites were killed. 
07012007	Jephthah judged Israel six years, and when he died, he was buried in one of the cities of Gilead. 
07012008	After Jephthah, Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. 
07012009	He had thirty sons, as well as thirty daughters whom he gave in marriage to men outside his clan; and for his sons he brought back thirty wives from elsewhere. Ibzan judged Israel seven years. 
07012010	Then Ibzan died, and he was buried in Bethlehem. 
07012011	After Ibzan, Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel ten years. 
07012012	Then Elon the Zebulunite died, and he was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun. 
07012013	After Elon, Abdon son of Hillel, from Pirathon, judged Israel. 
07012014	He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys. And he judged Israel eight years. 
07012015	Then Abdon son of Hillel, from Pirathon, died, and he was buried at Pirathon in Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites. 
07013001	Again the Israelites did evil in the sight of the LORD, so He delivered them into the hand of the Philistines for forty years. 
07013002	Now there was a man from Zorah named Manoah, from the clan of the Danites, whose wife was barren and had no children. 
07013003	The angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her, “It is true that you are barren and have no children; but you will conceive and give birth to a son. 
07013004	Now please be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, and not to eat anything unclean. 
07013005	For behold, you will conceive and give birth to a son. And no razor shall touch his head, because the boy will be a Nazirite to God from the womb, and he will begin the deliverance of Israel from the hand of the Philistines.” 
07013006	So the woman went and told her husband, “A man of God came to me. His appearance was like the angel of God, exceedingly awesome. I did not ask him where he came from, and he did not tell me his name. 
07013007	But he said to me, ‘Behold, you will conceive and give birth to a son. Now, therefore, do not drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean, because the boy will be a Nazirite to God from the womb until the day of his death.’” 
07013008	Then Manoah prayed to the LORD, “Please, O Lord, let the man of God You sent us come to us again to teach us how to raise the boy who is to be born.” 
07013009	And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God returned to the woman as she was sitting in the field; but her husband Manoah was not with her. 
07013010	The woman ran quickly to tell her husband, “Behold, the man who came to me the other day has reappeared!” 
07013011	So Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he asked, “Are you the man who spoke to my wife?” “I am,” he said. 
07013012	Then Manoah asked, “When your words come to pass, what will be the boy’s rule of life and mission?” 
07013013	So the angel of the LORD answered Manoah, “Your wife is to do everything I told her. 
07013014	She must not eat anything that comes from the vine, nor drink any wine or strong drink, nor eat anything unclean. She must do everything I have commanded her.” 
07013015	“Please stay here,” Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, “and we will prepare a young goat for you.” 
07013016	And the angel of the LORD replied, “Even if I stay, I will not eat your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to the LORD.” For Manoah did not know that it was the angel of the LORD. 
07013017	Then Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, “What is your name, so that we may honor you when your word comes to pass?” 
07013018	“Why do you ask my name,” said the angel of the LORD, “since it is beyond comprehension?” 
07013019	Then Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering and offered them on a rock to the LORD. And as Manoah and his wife looked on, the LORD did a marvelous thing. 
07013020	When the flame went up from the altar to the sky, the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame. When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell facedown to the ground. 
07013021	And when the angel of the LORD did not appear again to Manoah and his wife, Manoah realized that it had been the angel of the LORD. 
07013022	“We are going to die,” he said to his wife, “for we have seen God!” 
07013023	But his wife replied, “If the LORD had intended to kill us, He would not have accepted the burnt offering and the grain offering from our hands, nor would He have shown us all these things or spoken to us this way.” 
07013024	So the woman gave birth to a son and named him Samson. The boy grew, and the LORD blessed him. 
07013025	And the Spirit of the LORD began to stir him at Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol. 
07014001	One day Samson went down to Timnah, where he saw a young Philistine woman. 
07014002	So he returned and told his father and mother, “I have seen a daughter of the Philistines in Timnah. Now get her for me as a wife.” 
07014003	But his father and mother replied, “Can’t you find a young woman among your relatives or among any of our people? Must you go to the uncircumcised Philistines to get a wife?” But Samson told his father, “Get her for me, for she is pleasing to my eyes.” 
07014004	(Now his father and mother did not know this was from the LORD, who was seeking an occasion to move against the Philistines; for at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel.) 
07014005	Then Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother and came to the vineyards of Timnah. Suddenly a young lion came roaring at him, 
07014006	and the Spirit of the LORD came powerfully upon him, and he tore the lion apart with his bare hands as one would tear a young goat. But he did not tell his father or mother what he had done. 
07014007	Then Samson continued on his way down and spoke to the woman, because she was pleasing to his eyes. 
07014008	When Samson returned later to take her, he left the road to see the lion’s carcass, and in it was a swarm of bees, along with their honey. 
07014009	So he scooped some honey into his hands and ate it as he went along. And when he returned to his father and mother, he gave some to them and they ate it. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the lion’s carcass. 
07014010	Then his father went to visit the woman, and Samson prepared a feast there, as was customary for the bridegroom. 
07014011	And when the Philistines saw him, they selected thirty men to accompany him. 
07014012	“Let me tell you a riddle,” Samson said to them. “If you can solve it for me within the seven days of the feast, I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes. 
07014013	But if you cannot solve it, you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.” “Tell us your riddle,” they replied. “Let us hear it.” 
07014014	So he said to them: “Out of the eater came something to eat, and out of the strong came something sweet.” For three days they were unable to explain the riddle. 
07014015	So on the fourth day they said to Samson’s wife, “Entice your husband to explain the riddle to us, or we will burn you and your father’s household to death. Did you invite us here to rob us?” 
07014016	Then Samson’s wife came to him, weeping, and said, “You hate me! You do not really love me! You have posed to my people a riddle, but have not explained it to me.” “Look,” he said, “I have not even explained it to my father or mother, so why should I explain it to you?” 
07014017	She wept the whole seven days of the feast, and finally on the seventh day, because she had pressed him so much, he told her the answer. And in turn she explained the riddle to her people. 
07014018	Before sunset on the seventh day, the men of the city said to Samson: “What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion?” So he said to them: “If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have solved my riddle!” 
07014019	Then the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, killed thirty of their men, took their apparel, and gave their clothes to those who had solved the riddle. And burning with anger, Samson returned to his father’s house, 
07014020	and his wife was given to one of the men who had accompanied him. 
07015001	Later on, at the time of the wheat harvest, Samson took a young goat and went to visit his wife. “I want to go to my wife in her room,” he said. But her father would not let him enter. 
07015002	“I was sure that you thoroughly hated her,” said her father, “so I gave her to one of the men who accompanied you. Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please take her instead.” 
07015003	Samson said to them, “This time I will be blameless in doing harm to the Philistines.” 
07015004	Then Samson went out and caught three hundred foxes. And he took torches, turned the foxes tail-to-tail, and fastened a torch between each pair of tails. 
07015005	Then he lit the torches and released the foxes into the standing grain of the Philistines, burning up the piles of grain and the standing grain, as well as the vineyards and olive groves. 
07015006	“Who did this?” the Philistines demanded. “It was Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite,” they were told. “For his wife was given to his companion.” So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father to death. 
07015007	And Samson told them, “Because you have done this, I will not rest until I have taken vengeance upon you.” 
07015008	And he struck them ruthlessly with a great slaughter, and then went down and stayed in the cave at the rock of Etam. 
07015009	Then the Philistines went up, camped in Judah, and deployed themselves near the town of Lehi. 
07015010	“Why have you attacked us?” said the men of Judah. The Philistines replied, “We have come to arrest Samson and pay him back for what he has done to us.” 
07015011	In response, three thousand men of Judah went to the cave at the rock of Etam, and they asked Samson, “Do you not realize that the Philistines rule over us? What have you done to us?” “I have done to them what they did to me,” he replied. 
07015012	But they said to him, “We have come down to arrest you and hand you over to the Philistines.” Samson replied, “Swear to me that you will not kill me yourselves.” 
07015013	“No,” they answered, “we will not kill you, but we will tie you up securely and hand you over to them.” So they bound him with two new ropes and led him up from the rock. 
07015014	When Samson arrived in Lehi, the Philistines came out shouting against him. And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him. The ropes on his arms became like burnt flax, and the bonds broke loose from his hands. 
07015015	He found the fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached out his hand and took it, and struck down a thousand men. 
07015016	Then Samson said: “With the jawbone of a donkey I have piled them into heaps. With the jawbone of a donkey I have slain a thousand men.” 
07015017	And when Samson had finished speaking, he cast the jawbone from his hand; and he named that place Ramath-lehi. 
07015018	And being very thirsty, Samson cried out to the LORD, “You have accomplished this great deliverance through Your servant. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?” 
07015019	So God opened up the hollow place in Lehi, and water came out of it. When Samson drank, his strength returned, and he was revived. That is why he named it En-hakkore, and it remains in Lehi to this day. 
07015020	And Samson judged Israel for twenty years in the days of the Philistines. 
07016001	One day Samson went to Gaza, where he saw a prostitute and went in to spend the night with her. 
07016002	When the Gazites heard that Samson was there, they surrounded that place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate. They were quiet throughout the night, saying, “Let us wait until dawn; then we will kill him.” 
07016003	But Samson lay there only until midnight, when he got up, took hold of the doors of the city gate and both gateposts, and pulled them out, bar and all. Then he put them on his shoulders and took them to the top of the mountain overlooking Hebron. 
07016004	Some time later, Samson fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. 
07016005	The lords of the Philistines went to her and said, “Entice him and find out the source of his great strength and how we can overpower him to tie him up and subdue him. Then each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels of silver.” 
07016006	So Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me the source of your great strength and how you can be tied up and subdued.” 
07016007	Samson told her, “If they tie me up with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried, I will become as weak as any other man.” 
07016008	So the lords of the Philistines brought her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried, and she tied him up with them. 
07016009	While the men were hidden in her room, she called out, “Samson, the Philistines are here!” But he snapped the bowstrings like a strand of yarn seared by a flame. So the source of his strength remained unknown. 
07016010	Then Delilah said to Samson, “You have mocked me and lied to me! Now please tell me how you can be tied up.” 
07016011	He replied, “If they tie me up with new ropes that have never been used, I will become as weak as any other man.” 
07016012	So Delilah took new ropes, tied him up with them, and called out, “Samson, the Philistines are here!” But while the men were hidden in her room, he snapped the ropes off his arms like they were threads. 
07016013	Then Delilah said to Samson, “You have mocked me and lied to me all along! Tell me how you can be tied up.” He told her, “If you weave the seven braids of my head into the web of a loom and tighten it with a pin, I will become as weak as any other man. ” 
07016014	So while he slept, Delilah took the seven braids of his hair and wove them into the web. Then she tightened it with a pin and called to him, “Samson, the Philistines are here!” But he awoke from his sleep and pulled out the pin with the loom and the web. 
07016015	“How can you say, ‘I love you,’” she asked, “when your heart is not with me? This is the third time you have mocked me and failed to reveal to me the source of your great strength!” 
07016016	Finally, after she had pressed him daily with her words and pleaded until he was sick to death, 
07016017	Samson told her all that was in his heart: “My hair has never been cut, because I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother’s womb. If I am shaved, my strength will leave me, and I will become as weak as any other man.” 
07016018	When Delilah realized that he had revealed to her all that was in his heart, she sent this message to the lords of the Philistines: “Come up once more, for he has revealed to me all that is in his heart.” Then the lords of the Philistines came to her, bringing the money in their hands. 
07016019	And having lulled him to sleep on her lap, she called a man to shave off the seven braids of his head. In this way she began to subdue him, and his strength left him. 
07016020	Then she called out, “Samson, the Philistines are here!” When Samson awoke from his sleep, he thought, “I will escape as I did before and shake myself free.” But he did not know that the LORD had departed from him. 
07016021	Then the Philistines seized him, gouged out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, where he was bound with bronze shackles and forced to grind grain in the prison. 
07016022	However, the hair of his head began to grow back after it had been shaved. 
07016023	Now the lords of the Philistines gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon. They rejoiced and said, “Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hands.” 
07016024	And when the people saw him, they praised their god, saying: “Our god has delivered into our hands our enemy who destroyed our land and multiplied our dead.” 
07016025	And while their hearts were merry, they said, “Call for Samson to entertain us.” So they called Samson out of the prison to entertain them. And they stationed him between the pillars. 
07016026	Samson said to the servant who held his hand, “Lead me where I can feel the pillars supporting the temple, so I can lean against them.” 
07016027	Now the temple was full of men and women; all the lords of the Philistines were there, and about three thousand men and women were on the roof watching Samson entertain them. 
07016028	Then Samson called out to the LORD: “O Lord GOD, please remember me. Strengthen me, O God, just once more, so that with one vengeful blow I may pay back the Philistines for my two eyes.” 
07016029	And Samson reached out for the two central pillars supporting the temple. Bracing himself against them with his right hand on one pillar and his left hand on the other, 
07016030	Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines.” Then he pushed with all his might, and the temple fell on the lords and all the people in it. So in his death he killed more than he had killed in his life. 
07016031	Then Samson’s brothers and his father’s family came down, carried him back, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah. And he had judged Israel twenty years. 
07017001	Now a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim 
07017002	said to his mother, “The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you and about which I heard you utter a curse—I have the silver here with me; I took it.” Then his mother said, “Blessed be my son by the LORD!” 
07017003	And when he had returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, she said, “I wholly dedicate the silver to the LORD for my son’s benefit, to make a graven image and a molten idol. Therefore I will now return it to you.” 
07017004	So he returned the silver to his mother, and she took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to a silversmith, who made them into a graven image and a molten idol. And they were placed in the house of Micah. 
07017005	Now this man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and some household idols, and ordained one of his sons as his priest. 
07017006	In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes. 
07017007	And there was a young Levite from Bethlehem in Judah who had been residing within the clan of Judah. 
07017008	This man left the city of Bethlehem in Judah to settle where he could find a place. And as he traveled, he came to Micah’s house in the hill country of Ephraim. 
07017009	“Where are you from?” Micah asked him. “I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah,” he replied, “and I am on my way to settle wherever I can find a place.” 
07017010	“Stay with me,” Micah said to him, “and be my father and priest, and I will give you ten shekels of silver per year, a suit of clothes, and your provisions.” So the Levite went in 
07017011	and agreed to stay with him, and the young man became like a son to Micah. 
07017012	Micah ordained the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in his house. 
07017013	Then Micah said, “Now I know that the LORD will be good to me, because a Levite has become my priest.” 
07018001	In those days there was no king in Israel, and the tribe of the Danites was looking for territory to occupy. For up to that time they had not come into an inheritance among the tribes of Israel. 
07018002	So the Danites sent out five men from their clans, men of valor from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and explore it. “Go and explore the land,” they told them. The men entered the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah, where they spent the night. 
07018003	And while they were near Micah’s house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite; so they went over and asked him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? Why are you here?” 
07018004	“Micah has done this and that for me,” he replied, “and he has hired me to be his priest.” 
07018005	Then they said to him, “Please inquire of God to determine whether we will have a successful journey.” 
07018006	And the priest told them, “Go in peace. The LORD is watching over your journey.” 
07018007	So the five men departed and came to Laish, where they saw that the people were living securely, like the Sidonians, quiet and unsuspecting. There was nothing lacking in the land and no oppressive ruler. And they were far away from the Sidonians and had no alliance with anyone. 
07018008	When the men returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers asked them, “What did you find?” 
07018009	They answered, “Come on, let us go up against them, for we have seen the land, and it is very good. Why would you fail to act? Do not hesitate to go there and take possession of the land! 
07018010	When you enter, you will come to an unsuspecting people and a spacious land, for God has delivered it into your hand. It is a place where nothing on earth is lacking.” 
07018011	So six hundred Danites departed from Zorah and Eshtaol, armed with weapons of war. 
07018012	They went up and camped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. That is why the place west of Kiriath-jearim is called Mahaneh-dan to this day. 
07018013	And from there they traveled to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah’s house. 
07018014	Then the five men who had gone to spy out the land of Laish said to their brothers, “Did you know that one of these houses has an ephod, household gods, a graven image, and a molten idol? Now think about what you should do.” 
07018015	So they turned aside there and went to the home of the young Levite, the house of Micah, and greeted him. 
07018016	The six hundred Danites stood at the entrance of the gate, armed with their weapons of war. 
07018017	And the five men who had gone to spy out the land went inside and took the graven image, the ephod, the household idols, and the molten idol, while the priest stood at the entrance of the gate with the six hundred armed men. 
07018018	When they entered Micah’s house and took the graven image, the ephod, the household idols, and the molten idol, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?” 
07018019	“Be quiet,” they told him. “Put your hand over your mouth and come with us and be a father and a priest to us. Is it better for you to be a priest for the house of one person or a priest for a tribe and family in Israel?” 
07018020	So the priest was glad and took the ephod, the household idols, and the graven image, and went with the people. 
07018021	Putting their small children, their livestock, and their possessions in front of them, they turned and departed. 
07018022	After they were some distance from Micah’s house, the men in the houses near Micah’s house mobilized and overtook the Danites. 
07018023	When they called out after them, the Danites turned to face them and said to Micah, “What is the matter with you that you have called out such a company?” 
07018024	He replied, “You took the gods I had made, and my priest, and went away. What else do I have? How can you say to me, ‘What is the matter with you?’” 
07018025	The Danites said to him, “Do not raise your voice against us, or angry men will attack you, and you and your family will lose your lives.” 
07018026	So the Danites went on their way, and Micah turned to go back home, because he saw that they were too strong for him. 
07018027	After they had taken Micah’s idols and his priest, they went to Laish, to a quiet and unsuspecting people, and they struck them with their swords and burned down the city. 
07018028	There was no one to deliver them, because the city was far from Sidon and had no alliance with anyone; it was in a valley near Beth-rehob. And the Danites rebuilt the city and lived there. 
07018029	They named it Dan, after their forefather Dan, who was born to Israel—though the city was formerly named Laish. 
07018030	The Danites set up idols for themselves, and Jonathan son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land. 
07018031	So they set up for themselves Micah’s graven image, and it was there the whole time the house of God was in Shiloh. 
07019001	Now in those days, when there was no king in Israel, a Levite who lived in the remote hill country of Ephraim took for himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah. 
07019002	But she was unfaithful to him and left him to return to her father’s house in Bethlehem in Judah. After she had been there four months, 
07019003	her husband got up and went after her to speak kindly to her and bring her back, taking his servant and a pair of donkeys. So the girl brought him into her father’s house, and when her father saw him, he gladly welcomed him. 
07019004	His father-in-law, the girl’s father, persuaded him to stay, so he remained with him three days, eating, drinking, and lodging there. 
07019005	On the fourth day, they got up early in the morning and prepared to depart, but the girl’s father said to his son-in-law, “Refresh your heart with a morsel of bread, and then you can go.” 
07019006	So they sat down and the two of them ate and drank together. Then the girl’s father said to the man, “Please agree to stay overnight and let your heart be merry.” 
07019007	The man got up to depart, but his father-in-law persuaded him, so he stayed there that night. 
07019008	On the fifth day, he got up early in the morning to depart, but the girl’s father said, “Please refresh your heart.” So they waited until late afternoon and the two of them ate. 
07019009	When the man got up to depart with his concubine and his servant, his father-in-law, the girl’s father, said to him, “Look, the day is drawing to a close. Please spend the night. See, the day is almost over. Spend the night here, that your heart may be merry. Then you can get up early tomorrow for your journey home.” 
07019010	But the man was unwilling to spend the night. He got up and departed, and arrived opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), with his two saddled donkeys and his concubine. 
07019011	When they were near Jebus and the day was almost gone, the servant said to his master, “Please, let us stop at this Jebusite city and spend the night here.” 
07019012	But his master replied, “We will not turn aside to the city of foreigners, where there are no Israelites. We will go on to Gibeah.” 
07019013	He continued, “Come, let us try to reach one of these towns to spend the night in Gibeah or Ramah.” 
07019014	So they continued on their journey, and the sun set as they neared Gibeah in Benjamin. 
07019015	They stopped to go in and lodge in Gibeah. The Levite went in and sat down in the city square, but no one would take them into his home for the night. 
07019016	That evening an old man from the hill country of Ephraim, who was residing in Gibeah (the men of that place were Benjamites), came in from his work in the field. 
07019017	When he looked up and saw the traveler in the city square, the old man asked, “Where are you going, and where have you come from?” 
07019018	The Levite replied, “We are traveling from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote hill country of Ephraim, where I am from. I went to Bethlehem in Judah, and now I am going to the house of the LORD; but no one has taken me into his home, 
07019019	even though there is both straw and feed for our donkeys, and bread and wine for me and the maidservant and young man with me. There is nothing that we, your servants, lack.” 
07019020	“Peace to you,” said the old man. “Let me supply everything you need. Only do not spend the night in the square.” 
07019021	So he brought him to his house and fed his donkeys. And they washed their feet and ate and drank. 
07019022	While they were enjoying themselves, suddenly the wicked men of the city surrounded the house. Pounding on the door, they said to the old man who owned the house, “Bring out the man who came to your house, so we can have relations with him!” 
07019023	The owner of the house went out and said to them, “No, my brothers, do not do this wicked thing! After all, this man is a guest in my house. Do not commit this outrage. 
07019024	Look, let me bring out my virgin daughter and the man’s concubine, and you can use them and do with them as you wish. But do not do such a vile thing to this man.” 
07019025	But the men would not listen to him. So the Levite took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let her go. 
07019026	Early that morning, the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, collapsed at the doorway, and lay there until it was light. 
07019027	In the morning, when her master got up and opened the doors of the house to go out on his journey, there was his concubine, collapsed in the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold. 
07019028	“Get up,” he told her. “Let us go.” But there was no response. So the man put her on his donkey and set out for home. 
07019029	When he reached his house, he picked up a knife, took hold of his concubine, cut her limb by limb into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout the territory of Israel. 
07019030	And everyone who saw it said, “Nothing like this has been seen or done from the day the Israelites came out of the land of Egypt until this day. Think it over, take counsel, and speak up!” 
07020001	Then all the Israelites from Dan to Beersheba and from the land of Gilead came out, and the congregation assembled as one man before the LORD at Mizpah. 
07020002	The leaders of all the people and all the tribes of Israel presented themselves in the assembly of God’s people: 400,000 men on foot, armed with swords. 
07020003	(Meanwhile the Benjamites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah.) And the Israelites asked, “Tell us, how did this wicked thing happen?” 
07020004	So the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, answered: “I and my concubine came to Gibeah in Benjamin to spend the night. 
07020005	And during the night, the men of Gibeah rose up against me and surrounded the house. They intended to kill me, but they abused my concubine, and she died. 
07020006	Then I took my concubine, cut her into pieces, and sent her throughout the land of Israel’s inheritance, because they had committed a lewd and disgraceful act in Israel. 
07020007	Behold, all you Israelites, give your advice and verdict here and now.” 
07020008	Then all the people stood as one man and said, “Not one of us will return to his tent or to his house. 
07020009	Now this is what we will do to Gibeah: We will go against it as the lot dictates. 
07020010	We will take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred out of every thousand, and a thousand out of every ten thousand, to supply provisions for the army when they go to Gibeah in Benjamin to punish them for the atrocity they have committed in Israel.” 
07020011	So all the men of Israel gathered as one man, united against the city. 
07020012	And the tribes of Israel sent men throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What is this wickedness that has occurred among you? 
07020013	Hand over the wicked men of Gibeah so we can put them to death and purge Israel of this evil.” But the Benjamites refused to heed the voice of their fellow Israelites. 
07020014	And from their cities they came together at Gibeah to go out and fight against the Israelites. 
07020015	On that day the Benjamites mobilized 26,000 swordsmen from their cities, in addition to the 700 select men of Gibeah. 
07020016	Among all these soldiers there were 700 select left-handers, each of whom could sling a stone at a hair without missing. 
07020017	The Israelites, apart from Benjamin, mobilized 400,000 swordsmen, each one an experienced warrior. 
07020018	The Israelites set out, went up to Bethel, and inquired of God, “Who of us shall go up first to fight against the Benjamites?” “Judah will be first,” the LORD replied. 
07020019	The next morning the Israelites set out and camped near Gibeah. 
07020020	And the men of Israel went out to fight against Benjamin and took up their battle positions at Gibeah. 
07020021	And the Benjamites came out of Gibeah and cut down 22,000 Israelites on the battlefield that day. 
07020022	But the Israelite army took courage and again took their battle positions in the same place where they had arrayed themselves on the first day. 
07020023	They went up and wept before the LORD until evening, inquiring of Him, “Should we again draw near for battle against our brothers the Benjamites?” And the LORD answered, “Go up against them.” 
07020024	On the second day the Israelites advanced against the Benjamites. 
07020025	That same day the Benjamites came out against them from Gibeah and cut down another 18,000 Israelites, all of them armed with swords. 
07020026	Then the Israelites, all the people, went up to Bethel, where they sat weeping before the LORD. That day they fasted until evening and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings to the LORD. 
07020027	And the Israelites inquired of the LORD. (In those days the ark of the covenant of God was there, 
07020028	and Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, served before it.) The Israelites asked, “Should we again go out to battle against our brothers the Benjamites, or should we stop?” The LORD answered, “Fight, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand.” 
07020029	So Israel set up an ambush around Gibeah. 
07020030	On the third day the Israelites went up against the Benjamites and arrayed themselves against Gibeah as they had done before. 
07020031	The Benjamites came out against them and were drawn away from the city. They began to attack the people as before, killing about thirty men of Israel in the fields and on the roads, one of which led up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah. 
07020032	“We are defeating them as before,” said the Benjamites. But the Israelites said, “Let us retreat and draw them away from the city onto the roads.” 
07020033	So all the men of Israel got up from their places and arrayed themselves at Baal-tamar, and the Israelites in ambush charged from their positions west of Gibeah. 
07020034	Then 10,000 select men from all Israel made a frontal assault against Gibeah, and the battle was fierce. But the Benjamites did not realize that disaster was upon them. 
07020035	The LORD defeated Benjamin in the presence of Israel, and on that day the Israelites slaughtered 25,100 Benjamites, all armed with swords. 
07020036	Then the Benjamites realized they had been defeated. Now the men of Israel had retreated before Benjamin because they were relying on the ambush they had set against Gibeah. 
07020037	The men in ambush rushed suddenly against Gibeah; they advanced and put the whole city to the sword. 
07020038	The men of Israel had arranged a signal with the men in ambush: When they sent up a great cloud of smoke from the city, 
07020039	the men of Israel would turn in the battle. When the Benjamites had begun to strike them down, killing about thirty men of Israel, they said, “They are defeated before us as in the first battle.” 
07020040	But when the column of smoke began to go up from the city, the Benjamites looked behind them and saw the whole city going up in smoke. 
07020041	Then the men of Israel turned back on them, and the men of Benjamin were terrified when they realized that disaster had come upon them. 
07020042	So they fled before the men of Israel toward the wilderness, but the battle overtook them, and the men coming out of the cities struck them down there. 
07020043	They surrounded the Benjamites, pursued them, and easily overtook them in the vicinity of Gibeah on the east. 
07020044	And 18,000 Benjamites fell, all men of valor. 
07020045	Then the Benjamites turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and Israel cut down 5,000 men on the roads. And they overtook them at Gidom and struck down 2,000 more. 
07020046	That day 25,000 Benjamite swordsmen fell, all men of valor. 
07020047	But 600 men turned and fled into the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, where they stayed four months. 
07020048	And the men of Israel turned back against the other Benjamites and put to the sword all the cities, including the animals and everything else they found. And they burned down all the cities in their path. 
07021001	Now the men of Israel had sworn an oath at Mizpah, saying, “Not one of us will give his daughter in marriage to a Benjamite.” 
07021002	So the people came to Bethel and sat there before God until evening, lifting up their voices and weeping bitterly. 
07021003	“Why, O LORD God of Israel,” they cried out, “has this happened in Israel? Today in Israel one tribe is missing!” 
07021004	The next day the people got up early, built an altar there, and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings. 
07021005	The Israelites asked, “Who among all the tribes of Israel did not come to the assembly before the LORD?” For they had taken a solemn oath that anyone who failed to come up before the LORD at Mizpah would surely be put to death. 
07021006	And the Israelites grieved for their brothers, the Benjamites, and said, “Today a tribe is cut off from Israel. 
07021007	What should we do about wives for the survivors, since we have sworn by the LORD not to give them our daughters in marriage?” 
07021008	So they asked, “Which one of the tribes of Israel failed to come up before the LORD at Mizpah?” And, in fact, no one from Jabesh-gilead had come to the camp for the assembly. 
07021009	For when the people were counted, none of the residents of Jabesh-gilead were there. 
07021010	So the congregation sent 12,000 of their most valiant men and commanded them: “Go and put to the sword those living in Jabesh-gilead, including women and children. 
07021011	This is what you are to do: Devote to destruction every male, as well as every female who has had relations with a man.” 
07021012	So they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young women who had not had relations with a man, and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan. 
07021013	Then the whole congregation sent a message of peace to the Benjamites who were at the rock of Rimmon. 
07021014	And at that time the Benjamites returned and were given the women who were spared from Jabesh-gilead. But there were not enough women for all of them. 
07021015	The people grieved for Benjamin, because the LORD had made a void in the tribes of Israel. 
07021016	Then the elders of the congregation said, “What should we do about wives for those who remain, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?” 
07021017	They added, “There must be heirs for the survivors of Benjamin, so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out. 
07021018	But we cannot give them our daughters as wives.” For the Israelites had sworn, “Cursed is he who gives a wife to a Benjamite.” 
07021019	“But look,” they said, “there is a yearly feast to the LORD in Shiloh, which is north of Bethel east of the road that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.” 
07021020	So they commanded the Benjamites: “Go, hide in the vineyards 
07021021	and watch. When you see the daughters of Shiloh come out to perform their dances, each of you is to come out of the vineyards, catch for himself a wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin. 
07021022	When their fathers or brothers come to us to complain, we will tell them, ‘Do us a favor by helping them, since we did not get wives for each of them in the war. Since you did not actually give them your daughters, you have no guilt.’” 
07021023	The Benjamites did as instructed and carried away the number of women they needed from the dancers they caught. They went back to their own inheritance, rebuilt their cities, and settled in them. 
07021024	And at that time, each of the Israelites returned from there to his own tribe and clan, each to his own inheritance. 
07021025	In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes. 
08001001	In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land. And a certain man from Bethlehem in Judah, with his wife and two sons, went to reside in the land of Moab. 
08001002	The man’s name was Elimelech, his wife’s name was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah, and they entered the land of Moab and settled there. 
08001003	Then Naomi’s husband Elimelech died, and she was left with her two sons, 
08001004	who took Moabite women as their wives, one named Orpah and the other named Ruth. And after they had lived in Moab about ten years, 
08001005	both Mahlon and Chilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and without her husband. 
08001006	When Naomi heard in Moab that the LORD had attended to His people by providing them with food, she and her daughters-in-law prepared to leave the land of Moab. 
08001007	Accompanied by her two daughters-in-law, she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road leading back to the land of Judah. 
08001008	Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go back, each of you to your mother’s home. May the LORD show you loving devotion, as you have shown to your dead and to me. 
08001009	May the LORD enable each of you to find rest in the home of your new husband.” And she kissed them as they wept aloud 
08001010	and said, “Surely we will return with you to your people.” 
08001011	But Naomi replied, “Return home, my daughters. Why would you go with me? Are there still sons in my womb to become your husbands? 
08001012	Return home, my daughters. Go on, for I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was hope for me to have a husband tonight and to bear sons, 
08001013	would you wait for them to grow up? Would you refrain from having husbands? No, my daughters, it is much more bitter for me than for you, because the hand of the LORD has gone out against me.” 
08001014	Again they wept aloud, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth clung to her. 
08001015	“Look,” said Naomi, “your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and her gods; follow her back home.” 
08001016	But Ruth replied: “Do not urge me to leave you or to turn from following you. For wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you live, I will live; your people will be my people, and your God will be my God. 
08001017	Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD punish me, and ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me.” 
08001018	When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped trying to persuade her. 
08001019	So Naomi and Ruth traveled until they came to Bethlehem. When they entered Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women of the town exclaimed, “Can this be Naomi?” 
08001020	“Do not call me Naomi,” she replied. “Call me Mara, because the Almighty has dealt quite bitterly with me. 
08001021	I went away full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? After all, the LORD has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me.” 
08001022	So Naomi returned from the land of Moab with her daughter-in-law Ruth the Moabitess. And they arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest. 
08002001	Now Naomi had a relative on her husband’s side, a prominent man of noble character from the clan of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz. 
08002002	And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Please let me go into the fields and glean heads of grain after someone in whose sight I may find favor.” “Go ahead, my daughter,” Naomi replied. 
08002003	So Ruth departed and went out into the field and gleaned after the harvesters. And she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelech. 
08002004	Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and said to the harvesters, “The LORD be with you.” “The LORD bless you,” they replied. 
08002005	And Boaz asked the foreman of his harvesters, “Whose young woman is this?” 
08002006	The foreman answered, “She is the Moabitess who returned with Naomi from the land of Moab. 
08002007	She has said, ‘Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves after the harvesters.’ So she came out and has continued from morning until now, except that she rested a short time in the shelter.” 
08002008	Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Do not go and glean in another field, and do not go away from this place, but stay here close to my servant girls. 
08002009	Let your eyes be on the field they are harvesting, and follow along after these girls. Indeed, I have ordered the young men not to touch you. And when you are thirsty, go and drink from the jars the young men have filled.” 
08002010	At this, she fell on her face, bowing low to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you should take notice of me, even though I am a foreigner?” 
08002011	Boaz replied, “I have been made fully aware of all you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, how you left your father and mother and the land of your birth, and how you came to a people you did not know before. 
08002012	May the LORD repay your work, and may you receive a rich reward from the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have taken refuge.” 
08002013	“My lord,” she said, “may I continue to find favor in your eyes, for you have comforted and spoken kindly to your maidservant, though I am not like one of your servant girls.” 
08002014	At mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come over here; have some bread and dip it into the vinegar sauce.” So she sat down beside the harvesters, and he offered her roasted grain, and she ate and was satisfied and had some left over. 
08002015	When Ruth got up to glean, Boaz ordered his young men, “Even if she gathers among the sheaves, do not insult her. 
08002016	Rather, pull out for her some stalks from the bundles and leave them for her to gather. Do not rebuke her.” 
08002017	So Ruth gathered grain in the field until evening. And when she beat out what she had gleaned, it was about an ephah of barley. 
08002018	She picked up the grain and went into the town, where her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. And she brought out what she had saved from her meal and gave it to Naomi. 
08002019	Then her mother-in-law asked her, “Where did you glean today, and where did you work? Blessed be the man who noticed you.” So she told her mother-in-law where she had worked. “The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz,” she said. 
08002020	Then Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed by the LORD, who has not withdrawn His kindness from the living or the dead.” Naomi continued, “The man is a close relative. He is one of our kinsman-redeemers.” 
08002021	Then Ruth the Moabitess said, “He also told me, ‘Stay with my young men until they have finished gathering all my harvest.’” 
08002022	And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law Ruth, “My daughter, it is good for you to work with his young women, so that nothing will happen to you in another field.” 
08002023	So Ruth stayed close to the servant girls of Boaz to glean grain until the barley and wheat harvests were finished. And she lived with her mother-in-law. 
08003001	One day Ruth’s mother-in-law Naomi said to her, “My daughter, should I not seek a resting place for you, that it may be well with you? 
08003002	Now is not Boaz, with whose servant girls you have been working, a relative of ours? In fact, tonight he is winnowing barley on the threshing floor. 
08003003	Therefore wash yourself, put on perfume, and wear your best clothes. Go down to the threshing floor, but do not let the man know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking. 
08003004	When he lies down, note the place where he lies. Then go in and uncover his feet, and lie down, and he will explain to you what you should do.” 
08003005	“I will do everything you say,” Ruth answered. 
08003006	So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law had instructed her to do. 
08003007	After Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then Ruth went in secretly, uncovered his feet, and lay down. 
08003008	At midnight, Boaz was startled, turned over, and there lying at his feet was a woman! 
08003009	“Who are you?” he asked. “I am your servant Ruth,” she replied. “Spread the corner of your garment over me, for you are a kinsman-redeemer.” 
08003010	Then Boaz said, “May the LORD bless you, my daughter. You have shown more kindness now than before, because you have not run after the younger men, whether rich or poor. 
08003011	And now do not be afraid, my daughter. I will do for you whatever you request, since all my fellow townspeople know that you are a woman of noble character. 
08003012	Yes, it is true that I am a kinsman-redeemer, but there is a redeemer nearer than I. 
08003013	Stay here tonight, and in the morning, if he wants to redeem you, good. Let him redeem you. But if he does not want to redeem you, as surely as the LORD lives, I will. Now lie here until morning.” 
08003014	So she lay down at his feet until morning, but she got up before anyone else could recognize her. Then Boaz said, “Do not let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor.” 
08003015	And he told her, “Bring the shawl you are wearing and hold it out.” When she did so, he poured in six measures of barley and placed it on her. Then he went into the city. 
08003016	When Ruth returned to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked her, “How did it go, my daughter?” Then Ruth told her all that Boaz had done for her. 
08003017	And she said, “He gave me these six measures of barley, for he said, ‘Do not go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.’” 
08003018	“Wait, my daughter,” said Naomi, “until you find out how things go, for he will not rest unless he has resolved the matter today.” 
08004001	Meanwhile, Boaz went to the gate and sat down there. Soon the kinsman-redeemer of whom he had spoken came along, and Boaz said, “Come over here, my friend, and sit down.” So he went over and sat down. 
08004002	Then Boaz took ten of the elders of the city and said, “Sit here,” and they did so. 
08004003	And he said to the kinsman-redeemer, “Naomi, who has returned from the land of Moab, is selling the piece of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech. 
08004004	I thought I should inform you that you may buy it back in the presence of those seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you want to redeem it, do so. But if you will not redeem it, tell me so I may know, because there is no one but you to redeem it, and I am next after you.” “I will redeem it,” he replied. 
08004005	Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the land from Naomi and also from Ruth the Moabitess, you must also acquire the widow of the deceased in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance.” 
08004006	The kinsman-redeemer replied, “I cannot redeem it myself, or I would jeopardize my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption, because I cannot redeem it.” 
08004007	Now in former times in Israel, concerning the redemption or exchange of property, to make any matter legally binding a man would remove his sandal and give it to the other party, and this was a confirmation in Israel. 
08004008	So the kinsman-redeemer removed his sandal and said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself.” 
08004009	At this, Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You are witnesses today that I am buying from Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech, Chilion, and Mahlon. 
08004010	Moreover, I have acquired Ruth the Moabitess, Mahlon’s widow, as my wife, to raise up the name of the deceased through his inheritance, so that his name will not disappear from among his brothers or from the gate of his home. You are witnesses today.” 
08004011	“We are witnesses,” said the elders and all the people at the gate. “May the LORD make the woman entering your home like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you be prosperous in Ephrathah and famous in Bethlehem. 
08004012	And may your house become like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring the LORD will give you by this young woman.” 
08004013	So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife. And when he had relations with her, the LORD enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son. 
08004014	Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the LORD, who has not left you this day without a kinsman-redeemer. May his name become famous in Israel. 
08004015	He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. For your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given him birth.” 
08004016	And Naomi took the child, placed him on her lap, and became a nurse to him. 
08004017	The neighbor women said, “A son has been born to Naomi,” and they named him Obed. He became the father of Jesse, the father of David. 
08004018	Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez was the father of Hezron, 
08004019	Hezron was the father of Ram, Ram was the father of Amminadab, 
08004020	Amminadab was the father of Nahshon, Nahshon was the father of Salmon, 
08004021	Salmon was the father of Boaz, Boaz was the father of Obed, 
08004022	Obed was the father of Jesse, and Jesse was the father of David. 
09001001	Now there was a man named Elkanah who was from Ramathaim-zophim in the hill country of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. 
09001002	He had two wives, one named Hannah and the other Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none. 
09001003	Year after year Elkanah would go up from his city to worship and sacrifice to the LORD of Hosts at Shiloh, where Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to the LORD. 
09001004	And whenever the day came for Elkanah to present his sacrifice, he would give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters. 
09001005	But to Hannah he would give a double portion, for he loved her even though the LORD had closed her womb. 
09001006	Because the LORD had closed Hannah’s womb, her rival would provoke her viciously to taunt her. 
09001007	And this went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the LORD, her rival taunted her until she wept and would not eat. 
09001008	“Hannah, why are you crying?” her husband Elkanah asked. “Why won’t you eat? Why is your heart so grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?” 
09001009	So after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the temple of the LORD. 
09001010	In her bitter distress, Hannah prayed to the LORD and wept with many tears. 
09001011	And she made a vow, saying, “O LORD of Hosts, if only You will look upon the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, not forgetting Your maidservant but giving her a son, then I will dedicate him to the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall ever touch his head.” 
09001012	As Hannah kept on praying before the LORD, Eli watched her mouth. 
09001013	Hannah was praying in her heart, and though her lips were moving, her voice could not be heard. So Eli thought she was drunk 
09001014	and said to her, “How long will you be drunk? Put away your wine!” 
09001015	“No, my lord,” Hannah replied. “I am a woman troubled in spirit. I have not had any wine or strong drink, but I have poured out my soul before the LORD. 
09001016	Do not take your servant for a wicked woman, for all this time I have been praying out of the depth of my anguish and grief.” 
09001017	“Go in peace,” Eli replied, “and may the God of Israel grant the petition you have asked of Him.” 
09001018	“May your maidservant find favor with you,” said Hannah. Then she went on her way, and she began to eat, and her face was no longer downcast. 
09001019	The next morning they got up early to bow in worship before the LORD, and then they returned home to Ramah. And Elkanah had relations with his wife Hannah, and the LORD remembered her. 
09001020	So in the course of time, Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, saying, “Because I have asked for him from the LORD.” 
09001021	Then Elkanah and all his house went up to make the annual sacrifice to the LORD and to fulfill his vow, 
09001022	but Hannah did not go. “After the boy is weaned,” she said to her husband, “I will take him to appear before the LORD and to stay there permanently.” 
09001023	“Do what you think is best,” her husband Elkanah replied, “and stay here until you have weaned him. Only may the LORD confirm His word.” So Hannah stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him. 
09001024	Once she had weaned him, Hannah took the boy with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine. Though the boy was still young, she brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh. 
09001025	And when they had slaughtered the bull, they brought the boy to Eli. 
09001026	“Please, my lord,” said Hannah, “as surely as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the LORD. 
09001027	I prayed for this boy, and since the LORD has granted me what I asked of Him, 
09001028	I now dedicate the boy to the LORD. For as long as he lives, he is dedicated to the LORD.” So they worshiped the LORD there. 
09002001	At that time Hannah prayed: “My heart rejoices in the LORD; my horn is exalted in the LORD. My mouth speaks boldly against my enemies, for I rejoice in Your salvation. 
09002002	There is no one holy like the LORD. Indeed, there is no one besides You! And there is no Rock like our God. 
09002003	Do not boast so proudly, or let arrogance come from your mouth, for the LORD is a God who knows, and by Him actions are weighed. 
09002004	The bows of the mighty are broken, but the feeble are equipped with strength. 
09002005	The well-fed hire themselves out for food, but the starving hunger no more. The barren woman gives birth to seven, but she who has many sons pines away. 
09002006	The LORD brings death and gives life; He brings down to Sheol and raises up. 
09002007	The LORD sends poverty and wealth; He humbles and He exalts. 
09002008	He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap. He seats them among princes and bestows on them a throne of honor. For the foundations of the earth are the LORD’s, and upon them He has set the world. 
09002009	He guards the steps of His faithful ones, but the wicked perish in darkness; for by his own strength shall no man prevail. 
09002010	Those who oppose the LORD will be shattered. He will thunder from heaven against them. The LORD will judge the ends of the earth and will give power to His king. He will exalt the horn of His anointed.” 
09002011	Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy began ministering to the LORD before Eli the priest. 
09002012	Now the sons of Eli were wicked men; they had no regard for the LORD 
09002013	or for the custom of the priests with the people. When any man offered a sacrifice, the servant of the priest would come with a three-pronged meat fork while the meat was boiling 
09002014	and plunge it into the pan or kettle or cauldron or cooking pot. And the priest would claim for himself whatever the meat fork brought up. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh. 
09002015	Even before the fat was burned, the servant of the priest would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, “Give the priest some meat to roast, because he will not accept boiled meat from you, but only raw.” 
09002016	And if any man said to him, “The fat must be burned first; then you may take whatever you want,” the servant would reply, “No, you must give it to me right now. If you refuse, I will take it by force!” 
09002017	Thus the sin of these young men was severe in the sight of the LORD, for they were treating the LORD’s offering with contempt. 
09002018	Now Samuel was ministering before the LORD—a boy wearing a linen ephod. 
09002019	Each year his mother would make him a little robe and bring it to him when she went with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice. 
09002020	And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, “May the LORD give you children by this woman in place of the one she dedicated to the LORD.” Then they would go home. 
09002021	So the LORD attended to Hannah, and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the LORD. 
09002022	Now Eli was very old, and he heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they were sleeping with the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 
09002023	“Why are you doing these things?” Eli said to his sons. “I hear about your wicked deeds from all these people. 
09002024	No, my sons; it is not a good report I hear circulating among the LORD’s people. 
09002025	If a man sins against another man, God can intercede for him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?” But they would not listen to their father, since the LORD intended to put them to death. 
09002026	And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the LORD and with man. 
09002027	Then a man of God came to Eli and told him, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Did I not clearly reveal Myself to your father’s house when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh’s house? 
09002028	And out of all the tribes of Israel I selected your father to be My priest, to offer sacrifices on My altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in My presence. I also gave to the house of your father all the food offerings of the Israelites. 
09002029	Why then do you kick at My sacrifice and offering that I have prescribed for My dwelling place? You have honored your sons more than Me by fattening yourselves with the best of all the offerings of My people Israel.’ 
09002030	Therefore, the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: ‘I did indeed say that your house and the house of your father would walk before Me forever. But now the LORD declares: Far be it from Me! For I will honor those who honor Me, but those who despise Me will be disdained. 
09002031	Behold, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father’s house, so that no one in it will reach old age. 
09002032	You will see distress in My dwelling place. Despite all that is good in Israel, no one in your house will ever again reach old age. 
09002033	And every one of you that I do not cut off from My altar, I will cause your eyes to fail and your heart to grieve. All your descendants will die by the sword of men. 
09002034	And this sign shall come to you concerning your two sons Hophni and Phinehas: They will both die on the same day. 
09002035	Then I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest. He will do whatever is in My heart and mind. And I will build for him an enduring house, and he will walk before My anointed one for all time. 
09002036	And everyone left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver or a morsel of bread, pleading, “Please appoint me to some priestly office so that I can eat a piece of bread.”’” 
09003001	And the boy Samuel ministered to the LORD before Eli. Now in those days the word of the LORD was rare, and visions were scarce. 
09003002	And at that time Eli, whose eyesight had grown so dim that he could not see, was lying in his room. 
09003003	Before the lamp of God had gone out, Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was located. 
09003004	Then the LORD called to Samuel, and he answered, “Here I am.” 
09003005	He ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you have called me.” “I did not call,” Eli replied. “Go back and lie down.” So he went and lay down. 
09003006	Once again the LORD called, “Samuel!” So Samuel got up, went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you have called me.” “My son, I did not call,” Eli replied. “Go back and lie down.” 
09003007	Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, because the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him. 
09003008	Once again, for the third time, the LORD called to Samuel. He got up, went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you have called me.” Then Eli realized that it was the LORD who was calling the boy. 
09003009	“Go and lie down,” he said to Samuel, “and if He calls you, say, ‘Speak, LORD, for Your servant is listening.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his place. 
09003010	Then the LORD came and stood there, calling as before, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel answered, “Speak, for Your servant is listening.” 
09003011	Then the LORD said to Samuel, “I am about to do something in Israel at which the ears of all who hear it will tingle. 
09003012	On that day I will carry out against Eli everything I have spoken about his house, from beginning to end. 
09003013	I told him that I would judge his house forever for the iniquity of which he knows, because his sons blasphemed God and he did not restrain them. 
09003014	Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, ‘The iniquity of Eli’s house shall never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.’” 
09003015	Samuel lay down until the morning; then he opened the doors of the house of the LORD. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision, 
09003016	but Eli called to him and said, “Samuel, my son.” “Here I am,” answered Samuel. 
09003017	“What was the message He gave you?” Eli asked. “Do not hide it from me. May God punish you, and ever so severely, if you hide from me anything He said to you.” 
09003018	So Samuel told him everything and did not hide a thing from him. “He is the LORD,” replied Eli. “Let Him do what is good in His eyes.” 
09003019	And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and He let none of Samuel’s words fall to the ground. 
09003020	So all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the LORD. 
09003021	And the LORD continued to appear at Shiloh, because there He revealed Himself to Samuel by His word. 
09004001	Thus the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now the Israelites went out to meet the Philistines in battle and camped at Ebenezer, while the Philistines camped at Aphek. 
09004002	The Philistines arrayed themselves against Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who struck down about four thousand men on the battlefield. 
09004003	When the troops returned to the camp, the elders of Israel asked, “Why has the LORD brought defeat on us before the Philistines today? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD from Shiloh, so that it may go with us to save us from the hand of our enemies.” 
09004004	So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they brought back the ark of the covenant of the LORD of Hosts, who sits enthroned between the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God. 
09004005	When the ark of the covenant of the LORD entered the camp, all the Israelites raised such a great shout that the ground shook. 
09004006	On hearing the noise of the shout, the Philistines asked, “What is this loud shouting in the camp of the Hebrews?” And when they realized that the ark of the LORD had entered the camp, 
09004007	the Philistines were afraid. “The gods have entered their camp!” they said. “Woe to us, for nothing like this has happened before. 
09004008	Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness. 
09004009	Take courage and be men, O Philistines! Otherwise, you will serve the Hebrews just as they served you. Now be men and fight!” 
09004010	So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and each man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great—thirty thousand foot soldiers of Israel fell. 
09004011	The ark of God was captured, and Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died. 
09004012	That same day a Benjamite ran from the battle line all the way to Shiloh, with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. 
09004013	When he arrived, there was Eli, sitting on his chair beside the road and watching, because his heart trembled for the ark of God. When the man entered the city to give a report, the whole city cried out. 
09004014	Eli heard the outcry and asked, “Why this commotion?” So the man hurried over and reported to Eli. 
09004015	Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his gaze was fixed because he could not see. 
09004016	“I have just come from the battle,” the man said to Eli. “I fled from there today.” “What happened, my son?” Eli asked. 
09004017	The messenger answered, “Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been a great slaughter among the people. Your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are both dead, and the ark of God has been captured.” 
09004018	As soon as the ark of God was mentioned, Eli fell backward from his chair by the city gate, and being old and heavy, he broke his neck and died. And Eli had judged Israel forty years. 
09004019	Now Eli’s daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and about to give birth. When she heard the news of the capture of God’s ark and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband, she collapsed and gave birth, for her labor pains overtook her. 
09004020	As she was dying, the women attending to her said, “Do not be afraid, for you have given birth to a son!” But she did not respond or pay any heed. 
09004021	And she named the boy Ichabod, saying, “The glory has departed from Israel,” because the ark of God had been captured and her father-in-law and her husband had been killed. 
09004022	“The glory has departed from Israel,” she said, “for the ark of God has been captured.” 
09005001	After the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod, 
09005002	carried it into the temple of Dagon, and set it beside his statue. 
09005003	When the people of Ashdod got up early the next morning, there was Dagon, fallen on his face before the ark of the LORD. So they took Dagon and returned him to his place. 
09005004	But when they got up early the next morning, there was Dagon, fallen on his face before the ark of the LORD, with his head and his hands broken off and lying on the threshold. Only the torso remained. 
09005005	That is why, to this day, the priests of Dagon and all who enter the temple of Dagon in Ashdod do not step on the threshold. 
09005006	Now the hand of the LORD was heavy on the people of Ashdod and its vicinity, ravaging them and afflicting them with tumors. 
09005007	And when the men of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel must not stay here with us, because His hand is heavy upon us and upon our god Dagon.” 
09005008	So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and asked, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” “It must be moved to Gath,” they replied. So they carried away the ark of the God of Israel. 
09005009	But after they had moved the ark to Gath, the LORD’s hand was also against that city, throwing it into great confusion and afflicting the men of the city, both young and old, with an outbreak of tumors. 
09005010	So they sent the ark of God to Ekron, but as it arrived, the Ekronites cried out, “They have brought us the ark of the God of Israel in order to kill us and our people!” 
09005011	Then the Ekronites called together all the rulers of the Philistines and said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel. It must return to its place, so that it will not kill us and our people!” For a deadly confusion had pervaded the city; the hand of God was very heavy upon it. 
09005012	Those who did not die were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven. 
09006001	When the ark of the LORD had been in the land of the Philistines seven months, 
09006002	the Philistines summoned the priests and diviners, saying, “What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us how to send it back to its place.” 
09006003	They replied, “If you return the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it away empty, but by all means return it to Him with a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and you will understand why His hand has not been lifted from you.” 
09006004	“What guilt offering should we send back to Him?” asked the Philistines. “Five gold tumors and five gold rats,” they said, “according to the number of rulers of the Philistines, since the same plague has struck both you and your rulers. 
09006005	Make images of your tumors and of the rats that are ravaging the land. Give glory to the God of Israel, and perhaps He will lift His hand from you and your gods and your land. 
09006006	Why harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened theirs? When He afflicted them, did they not send the people out so they could go on their way? 
09006007	Now, therefore, prepare one new cart with two milk cows that have never been yoked. Hitch the cows to the cart, but take their calves away and pen them up. 
09006008	Take the ark of the LORD, set it on the cart, and in a chest beside it put the gold objects you are sending back to Him as a guilt offering. Then send the ark on its way, 
09006009	but keep watching it. If it goes up the road to its homeland, toward Beth-shemesh, it is the LORD who has brought on us this great disaster. But if it does not, then we will know that it was not His hand that punished us and that it happened by chance.” 
09006010	So the men did as instructed. They took two milk cows, hitched them to the cart, and penned up their calves. 
09006011	Then they put the ark of the LORD on the cart, along with the chest containing the gold rats and the images of the tumors. 
09006012	And the cows headed straight up the road toward Beth-shemesh, staying on that one highway and lowing as they went, never straying to the right or to the left. The rulers of the Philistines followed behind them to the border of Beth-shemesh. 
09006013	Now the people of Beth-shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley, and when they looked up and saw the ark, they were overjoyed at the sight. 
09006014	The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh and stopped there near a large rock. The people chopped up the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD. 
09006015	And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the chest containing the gold objects, and they placed them on the large rock. That day the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the LORD. 
09006016	And when the five rulers of the Philistines saw this, they returned to Ekron that same day. 
09006017	As a guilt offering to the LORD, the Philistines had sent back one gold tumor for each city: Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron. 
09006018	The number of gold rats also corresponded to the number of Philistine cities belonging to the five rulers—the fortified cities and their outlying villages. And the large rock on which they placed the ark of the LORD stands to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh. 
09006019	But God struck down some of the people of Beth-shemesh because they looked inside the ark of the LORD. He struck down seventy men, and the people mourned because the LORD had struck them with a great slaughter. 
09006020	The men of Beth-shemesh asked, “Who can stand in the presence of the LORD, this holy God? To whom should the ark go up from here?” 
09006021	So they sent messengers to the people of Kiriath-jearim, saying, “The Philistines have returned the ark of the LORD. Come down and take it up with you.” 
09007001	Then the men of Kiriath-jearim came for the ark of the LORD and took it into Abinadab’s house on the hill. And they consecrated his son Eleazar to guard the ark of the LORD. 
09007002	And from that day a long time passed, twenty years in all, as the ark remained at Kiriath-jearim. And all the house of Israel mournfully sought the LORD. 
09007003	Then Samuel said to all the house of Israel, “If you are returning to the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the foreign gods and Ashtoreths among you, prepare your hearts for the LORD, and serve Him only. And He will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.” 
09007004	So the Israelites put away the Baals and Ashtoreths and served only the LORD. 
09007005	Then Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to the LORD on your behalf.” 
09007006	When they had gathered at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before the LORD. On that day they fasted, and there they confessed, “We have sinned against the LORD.” And Samuel judged the Israelites at Mizpah. 
09007007	When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, their rulers marched up toward Israel. And when the Israelites learned of this, they feared the Philistines 
09007008	and said to Samuel, “Do not stop crying out to the LORD our God for us, that He may save us from the hand of the Philistines.” 
09007009	Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD. He cried out to the LORD on behalf of Israel, and the LORD answered him. 
09007010	As the Philistines drew near to fight against Israel, Samuel was offering up the burnt offering. But that day the LORD thundered loudly against the Philistines and threw them into such confusion that they fled before Israel. 
09007011	Then the men of Israel charged out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, striking them down all the way to an area below Beth-car. 
09007012	Afterward, Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer, saying, “Thus far the LORD has helped us.” 
09007013	So the Philistines were subdued, and they stopped invading the territory of Israel. And the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel. 
09007014	The cities from Ekron to Gath, which the Philistines had taken, were restored to Israel, who also delivered the surrounding territory from the hand of the Philistines. And there was peace between the Israelites and the Amorites. 
09007015	So Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 
09007016	Every year he would go on a circuit from Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah, judging Israel in all these places. 
09007017	Then he would return to Ramah because his home was there, and there he judged Israel and built an altar to the LORD. 
09008001	When Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons as judges over Israel. 
09008002	The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second was Abijah. They were judges in Beersheba. 
09008003	But his sons did not walk in his ways; they turned aside toward dishonest gain, accepting bribes and perverting justice. 
09008004	So all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah. 
09008005	“Look,” they said, “you are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint a king to judge us like all the other nations.” 
09008006	But when they said, “Give us a king to judge us,” their demand was displeasing in the sight of Samuel; so he prayed to the LORD. 
09008007	And the LORD said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say to you. For it is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected Me as their king. 
09008008	Just as they have done from the day I brought them up out of Egypt until this day, forsaking Me and serving other gods, so they are doing to you. 
09008009	Now listen to their voice; but you must solemnly warn them and show them the manner of the king who will reign over them.” 
09008010	So Samuel spoke all the words of the LORD to the people who were asking him for a king. 
09008011	He said, “This will be the manner of the king who will reign over you: He will take your sons and appoint them to serve his own chariots and horses, and to run in front of his chariots. 
09008012	He will appoint some for himself as commanders of thousands and of fifties, and others to plow his ground, to reap his harvest, and to make his weapons of war and equipment for his chariots. 
09008013	And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, cooks, and bakers. 
09008014	He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his servants. 
09008015	He will take a tenth of your grain and grape harvest and give it to his officials and servants. 
09008016	And he will take your menservants and maidservants and your best cattle and donkeys and put them to his own use. 
09008017	He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his slaves. 
09008018	When that day comes, you will beg for relief from the king you have chosen, but the LORD will not answer you on that day.” 
09008019	Nevertheless, the people refused to listen to Samuel. “No!” they said. “We must have a king over us. 
09008020	Then we will be like all the other nations, with a king to judge us, to go out before us, and to fight our battles.” 
09008021	Samuel listened to all the words of the people and repeated them in the hearing of the LORD. 
09008022	“Listen to their voice,” the LORD said to Samuel. “Appoint a king for them.” Then Samuel told the men of Israel, “Everyone must go back to his city.” 
09009001	Now there was a Benjamite, a powerful man, whose name was Kish son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah of Benjamin. 
09009002	And he had a son named Saul, choice and handsome, without equal among the Israelites—a head taller than any of the people. 
09009003	One day the donkeys of Saul’s father Kish wandered off, and Kish said to his son Saul, “Take one of the servants and go look for the donkeys.” 
09009004	So Saul passed through the hill country of Ephraim and then through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find the donkeys. He and the servant went through the region of Shaalim, but they were not there. Then they went through the land of Benjamin, and still they did not find them. 
09009005	When they reached the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant, “Come, let us go back, or my father will stop worrying about the donkeys and start worrying about us.” 
09009006	“Look,” said the servant, “in this city there is a man of God who is highly respected; everything he says surely comes to pass. Let us go there now. Perhaps he will tell us which way to go.” 
09009007	“If we do go,” Saul replied, “what can we give the man? For the bread in our packs is gone, and there is no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?” 
09009008	The servant answered him again. “Look,” he said, “I have here in my hand a quarter shekel of silver. I will give it to the man of God, and he will tell us our way.” 
09009009	(Formerly in Israel, a man on his way to inquire of God would say, “Come, let us go to the seer.” For the prophet of today was formerly called the seer.) 
09009010	“Good,” said Saul to his servant. “Come, let us go.” So they set out for the city where the man of God was. 
09009011	And as they were climbing the hill to the city, they met some young women coming out to draw water and asked, “Is the seer here?” 
09009012	“Yes, he is ahead of you,” they answered. “Hurry now, for today he has come to the city because the people have a sacrifice on the high place. 
09009013	As soon as you enter the city, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; after that, the guests will eat. Go up at once; you will find him.” 
09009014	So Saul and his servant went up toward the city, and as they were entering it, there was Samuel coming toward them on his way up to the high place. 
09009015	Now on the day before Saul’s arrival, the LORD had revealed to Samuel, 
09009016	“At this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you are to anoint him ruler over My people Israel; he will save them from the hand of the Philistines. For I have looked upon My people, because their cry has come to Me.” 
09009017	When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD told him, “Here is the man of whom I spoke; he shall rule over My people.” 
09009018	Saul approached Samuel in the gateway and asked, “Would you please tell me where the seer’s house is?” 
09009019	“I am the seer,” Samuel replied. “Go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today. And when I send you off in the morning, I will tell you all that is in your heart. 
09009020	As for the donkeys you lost three days ago, do not worry about them, for they have been found. And upon whom is all the desire of Israel, if not upon you and all your father’s house?” 
09009021	Saul replied, “Am I not a Benjamite from the smallest tribe of Israel, and is not my clan the least of all the clans of Benjamin? So why would you say such a thing to me?” 
09009022	Then Samuel took Saul and his servant, brought them into the hall, and seated them in the place of honor among those who were invited—about thirty in all. 
09009023	And Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the portion I gave you and told you to set aside.” 
09009024	So the cook picked up the leg and what was attached to it and set it before Saul. Then Samuel said, “Here is what was kept back. It was set apart for you. Eat, for it has been kept for you for this occasion, from the time I said, ‘I have invited the people.’” So Saul dined with Samuel that day. 
09009025	And after they had come down from the high place into the city, Samuel spoke with Saul on the roof of his house. 
09009026	They got up early in the morning, and just before dawn Samuel called to Saul on the roof, “Get ready, and I will send you on your way!” So Saul got ready, and both he and Samuel went outside together. 
09009027	As they were going down to the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us, but you stay for a while, and I will reveal to you the word of God.” So the servant went on. 
09010001	Then Samuel took a flask of oil, poured it on Saul’s head, kissed him, and said, “Has not the LORD anointed you ruler over His inheritance? 
09010002	When you leave me today, you will find two men at Rachel’s tomb in Zelzah on the border of Benjamin. They will say to you, ‘The donkeys you seek have been found, and now your father has stopped worrying about the donkeys and started worrying about you, asking, “What should I do about my son?”’ 
09010003	Then you will go on from there until you come to the Oak of Tabor. Three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there, one carrying three young goats, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine. 
09010004	They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you will accept from their hands. 
09010005	After that you will come to Gibeah of God, where the Philistines have an outpost. As you approach the city, you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place, preceded by harps, tambourines, flutes, and lyres, and they will be prophesying. 
09010006	Then the Spirit of the LORD will rush upon you, and you will prophesy with them; and you will be transformed into a different person. 
09010007	When these signs have come, do as the occasion demands, for God is with you. 
09010008	And you shall go before me to Gilgal, and surely I will come to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice peace offerings. Wait seven days until I come to you and show you what you are to do.” 
09010009	As Saul turned to leave Samuel, God changed Saul’s heart, and all the signs came to pass that day. 
09010010	When Saul and his servant arrived at Gibeah, a group of prophets met him. Then the Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he prophesied along with them. 
09010011	When all those who had formerly known Saul saw him prophesying with the prophets, they asked one another, “What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?” 
09010012	Then a man who lived there replied, “And who is their father?” So the saying became a proverb: “Is Saul also among the prophets?” 
09010013	And when Saul had finished prophesying, he went up to the high place. 
09010014	Now Saul’s uncle asked him and his servant, “Where did you go?” “To look for the donkeys,” Saul replied. “When we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.” 
09010015	“Tell me,” Saul’s uncle asked, “what did Samuel say to you?” 
09010016	And Saul replied, “He assured us that the donkeys had been found.” But Saul did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about the kingship. 
09010017	After this, Samuel summoned the people to the LORD at Mizpah 
09010018	and said to the Israelites, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘I brought Israel up out of Egypt, and I rescued you from the hands of the Egyptians and of all the kingdoms that oppressed you.’ 
09010019	But today you have rejected your God, who saves you from all your troubles and afflictions, and you have said to Him, ‘No, set a king over us.’ Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and clans.” 
09010020	Thus Samuel had all the tribes of Israel come forward, and the tribe of Benjamin was selected. 
09010021	Then he had the tribe of Benjamin come forward by its clans, and the clan of Matri was selected. Finally, Saul son of Kish was selected. But when they looked for him, they could not find him. 
09010022	So again they inquired of the LORD, “Has the man come here yet?” And the LORD replied, “Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage.” 
09010023	So they ran and brought Saul, and when he stood among the people, he was a head taller than any of the others. 
09010024	Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see the one the LORD has chosen? There is no one like him among all the people.” And all the people shouted, “Long live the king!” 
09010025	Then Samuel explained to the people the rights of kingship. He wrote them on a scroll and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, each to his own home. 
09010026	Saul also went to his home in Gibeah, and the men of valor whose hearts God had touched went with him. 
09010027	But some worthless men said, “How can this man save us?” So they despised him and brought him no gifts; but Saul remained silent about it. 
09011001	Then Nahash the Ammonite came up and laid siege to Jabesh-gilead. All the men of Jabesh said to him, “Make a treaty with us, and we will serve you.” 
09011002	But Nahash the Ammonite replied, “I will make a treaty with you on one condition, that I may put out everyone’s right eye and bring reproach upon all Israel.” 
09011003	“Hold off for seven days,” replied the elders of Jabesh, “and let us send messengers throughout Israel. If there is no one to save us, we will surrender to you.” 
09011004	When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and relayed these words in the hearing of the people, they all wept aloud. 
09011005	Just then Saul was returning from the field, behind his oxen. “What troubles the people?” asked Saul. “Why are they weeping?” And they relayed to him the words of the men from Jabesh. 
09011006	When Saul heard their words, the Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he burned with great anger. 
09011007	He took a pair of oxen, cut them into pieces, and sent them by messengers throughout the land of Israel, proclaiming, “This is what will be done to the oxen of anyone who does not march behind Saul and Samuel.” Then the terror of the LORD fell upon the people, and they came out together as one man. 
09011008	And when Saul numbered them at Bezek, there were 300,000 Israelites and 30,000 men of Judah. 
09011009	So they said to the messengers who had come, “Tell the men of Jabesh-gilead: ‘Deliverance will be yours tomorrow by the time the sun is hot.’” And when the messengers relayed this to the men of Jabesh, they rejoiced. 
09011010	Then the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Tomorrow we will come out, and you can do with us whatever seems good to you.” 
09011011	The next day Saul organized the troops into three divisions, and during the morning watch they invaded the camp of the Ammonites and slaughtered them, until the hottest part of the day. And the survivors were so scattered that no two of them were left together. 
09011012	Then the people said to Samuel, “Who said that Saul should not reign over us? Bring those men here so we can kill them!” 
09011013	But Saul ordered, “No one shall be put to death this day, for today the LORD has worked salvation in Israel.” 
09011014	Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go to Gilgal and renew the kingship there.” 
09011015	So all the people went to Gilgal and confirmed Saul as king in the presence of the LORD. There they sacrificed peace offerings before the LORD, and Saul and all the Israelites rejoiced greatly. 
09012001	Then Samuel said to all Israel, “I have listened to your voice in all that you have said to me, and I have set over you a king. 
09012002	Now here is the king walking before you, and I am old and gray, and my sons are here with you. I have walked before you from my youth until this day. 
09012003	Here I am. Bear witness against me before the LORD and before His anointed: Whose ox or donkey have I taken? Whom have I cheated or oppressed? From whose hand have I accepted a bribe and closed my eyes? Tell me, and I will restore it to you.” 
09012004	“You have not cheated us or oppressed us,” they replied, “nor have you taken anything from the hand of man.” 
09012005	Samuel said to them, “The LORD is a witness against you, and His anointed is a witness today, that you have not found anything in my hand.” “He is a witness,” they replied. 
09012006	Then Samuel said to the people, “The LORD is the One who appointed Moses and Aaron, and who brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt. 
09012007	Now present yourselves, so that I may confront you before the LORD with all the righteous acts He has done for you and your fathers. 
09012008	When Jacob went to Egypt, your fathers cried out to the LORD, and He sent them Moses and Aaron, who brought your fathers out of Egypt and settled them in this place. 
09012009	But they forgot the LORD their God, and He sold them into the hand of Sisera the commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hands of the Philistines and the king of Moab, who fought against them. 
09012010	Then they cried out to the LORD and said, ‘We have sinned, for we have forsaken the LORD and served the Baals and Ashtoreths. Now deliver us from the hands of our enemies, that we may serve You.’ 
09012011	So the LORD sent Jerubbaal, Barak, Jephthah, and Samuel, and He delivered you from the hands of your enemies on every side, and you dwelt securely. 
09012012	But when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites was moving against you, you said to me, ‘No, we must have a king to rule over us’—even though the LORD your God was your king. 
09012013	Now here is the king you have chosen, the one you requested. Behold, the LORD has placed a king over you. 
09012014	If you fear the LORD and serve Him and obey His voice, and if you do not rebel against the command of the LORD, and if both you and the king who rules over you follow the LORD your God, then all will be well. 
09012015	But if you disobey the LORD and rebel against His command, then the hand of the LORD will be against you as it was against your fathers. 
09012016	Now, therefore, present yourselves and see this great thing that the LORD will do before your eyes. 
09012017	Is it not the wheat harvest today? I will call on the LORD to send thunder and rain, so that you will know and see what a great evil you have committed in the sight of the LORD by asking for a king.” 
09012018	So Samuel called to the LORD, and on that day the LORD sent thunder and rain. As a result, all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel. 
09012019	They pleaded with Samuel, “Pray to the LORD your God for your servants so that we will not die! For we have added to all our sins the evil of asking for a king.” 
09012020	“Do not be afraid,” Samuel replied. “Even though you have committed all this evil, do not turn aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart. 
09012021	Do not turn aside after worthless things that cannot profit you or deliver you, for they are empty. 
09012022	Indeed, for the sake of His great name, the LORD will not abandon His people, because He was pleased to make you His own. 
09012023	As for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by ceasing to pray for you. And I will continue to teach you the good and right way. 
09012024	Above all, fear the LORD and serve Him faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things He has done for you. 
09012025	But if you persist in doing evil, both you and your king will be swept away.” 
09013001	Saul was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned over Israel forty-two years. 
09013002	He chose for himself three thousand men of Israel: Two thousand were with Saul at Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. And the rest of the troops he sent away, each to his own home. 
09013003	Then Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. So Saul blew the ram’s horn throughout the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!” 
09013004	And all Israel heard the news: “Saul has attacked an outpost of the Philistines, and now Israel has become a stench to the Philistines!” Then the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal. 
09013005	Now the Philistines assembled to fight against Israel with three thousand chariots, six thousand horsemen, and troops as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Michmash, east of Beth-aven. 
09013006	Seeing that they were in danger because their troops were hard-pressed, the men of Israel hid in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in cellars and cisterns. 
09013007	Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan into the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul, however, remained at Gilgal, and all his troops were quaking in fear. 
09013008	And Saul waited seven days for the time appointed by Samuel, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the troops began to desert Saul. 
09013009	So he said, “Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings.” And he offered up the burnt offering. 
09013010	Just as he finished offering the burnt offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him. 
09013011	“What have you done?” Samuel asked. And Saul replied, “When I saw that the troops were deserting me, and that you did not come at the appointed time and the Philistines were gathering at Michmash, 
09013012	I thought, ‘Now the Philistines will descend upon me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the favor of the LORD.’ So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering.” 
09013013	“You have acted foolishly,” Samuel declared. “You have not kept the command that the LORD your God gave you; if you had, the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time. 
09013014	But now your kingdom will not endure; the LORD has sought a man after His own heart and appointed him ruler over His people, because you have not kept the command of the LORD.” 
09013015	Then Samuel set out from Gilgal and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin. And Saul numbered the troops who were with him, about six hundred men. 
09013016	Now Saul and Jonathan his son and the troops with them were staying in Geba of Benjamin, while the Philistines camped at Michmash. 
09013017	And raiders went out of the Philistine camp in three divisions. One headed toward Ophrah in the land of Shual, 
09013018	another toward Beth-horon, and the third down the border road overlooking the Valley of Zeboim facing the wilderness. 
09013019	And no blacksmith could be found in all the land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, “The Hebrews must not be allowed to make swords or spears.” 
09013020	Instead, all the Israelites would go down to the Philistines to sharpen their plowshares, mattocks, axes, and sickles. 
09013021	The charge was a pim for sharpening a plowshare or mattock, a third of a shekel for sharpening a pitchfork or an axe, and a third of a shekel for repointing an oxgoad. 
09013022	So on the day of battle not a sword or spear could be found in the hands of the troops with Saul and Jonathan; only Saul and his son Jonathan had weapons. 
09013023	And a garrison of the Philistines had gone out to the pass at Michmash. 
09014001	One day Jonathan son of Saul said to the young man bearing his armor, “Come, let us cross over to the Philistine outpost on the other side.” But Jonathan did not tell his father. 
09014002	Meanwhile, Saul was staying under the pomegranate tree in Migron on the outskirts of Gibeah. And the troops who were with him numbered about six hundred men, 
09014003	including Ahijah, who was wearing an ephod. He was the son of Ichabod’s brother Ahitub son of Phinehas, the son of Eli the priest of the LORD in Shiloh. But the troops did not know that Jonathan had left. 
09014004	Now there were cliffs on both sides of the pass that Jonathan intended to cross to reach the Philistine outpost. One was named Bozez and the other Seneh. 
09014005	One cliff stood to the north toward Michmash, and the other to the south toward Geba. 
09014006	Jonathan said to the young man bearing his armor, “Come, let us cross over to the outpost of these uncircumcised men. Perhaps the LORD will work on our behalf. Nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few.” 
09014007	His armor-bearer replied, “Do all that is in your heart. Go ahead; I am with you heart and soul.” 
09014008	“Very well,” said Jonathan, “we will cross over toward these men and show ourselves to them. 
09014009	If they say, ‘Wait until we come to you,’ then we will stay where we are and will not go up to them. 
09014010	But if they say, ‘Come on up,’ then we will go up, because this will be our sign that the LORD has delivered them into our hands.” 
09014011	So the two of them showed themselves to the outpost of the Philistines, who exclaimed, “Look, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes in which they were hiding!” 
09014012	So the men of the outpost called out to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, “Come on up, and we will teach you a lesson!” “Follow me,” Jonathan told his armor-bearer, “for the LORD has delivered them into the hand of Israel.” 
09014013	So Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer behind him. And the Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed and finished them off. 
09014014	In that first assault, Jonathan and his armor-bearer struck down about twenty men in about half an acre of land. 
09014015	Then panic struck the Philistines in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. Even those in the outposts and raiding parties trembled. Indeed, the earth quaked, and panic spread from God. 
09014016	Now when Saul’s watchmen at Gibeah in Benjamin looked and saw the troops melting away and scattering in every direction, 
09014017	Saul said to the troops who were with him, “Call the roll and see who has left us.” And when they had called the roll, they saw that Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there. 
09014018	Then Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God.” (For at that time it was with the Israelites.) 
09014019	While Saul was talking to the priest, the commotion in the Philistine camp continued to increase. So Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.” 
09014020	Then Saul and all his troops assembled and marched to the battle, and they found the Philistines in total confusion, with each man wielding the sword against his neighbor. 
09014021	And the Hebrews who had previously gone up into the surrounding camps to join the Philistines now went over to the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. 
09014022	When all the Israelites who had been hiding in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they also joined the battle in close pursuit. 
09014023	So the LORD saved Israel that day, and the battle moved on beyond Beth-aven. 
09014024	Now the men of Israel were in distress that day, for Saul had placed the troops under an oath, saying, “Cursed is the man who eats any food before evening, before I have taken vengeance on my enemies.” So none of the troops tasted any food. 
09014025	Then all the troops entered the forest, and there was honey on the ground. 
09014026	And when they entered the forest and saw the flowing honey, not one of them put his hand to his mouth, because they feared the oath. 
09014027	Jonathan, however, had not heard that his father had bound the people with the oath. So he reached out the end of the staff in his hand, dipped it into the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened. 
09014028	Then one of the soldiers told him, “Your father bound the troops with a solemn oath, saying, ‘Cursed is the man who eats food today.’ That is why the people are faint.” 
09014029	“My father has brought trouble to the land,” Jonathan replied. “Just look at how my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey. 
09014030	How much better it would have been if the troops had eaten freely today from the plunder they took from their enemies! Would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been much greater?” 
09014031	That day, after the Israelites had struck down the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon, the people were very faint. 
09014032	So they rushed greedily to the plunder, taking sheep, cattle, and calves. They slaughtered them on the ground and ate meat with the blood still in it. 
09014033	Then someone reported to Saul: “Look, the troops are sinning against the LORD by eating meat with the blood still in it.” “You have broken faith,” said Saul. “Roll a large stone over here at once.” 
09014034	Then he said, “Go among the troops and tell them, ‘Each man must bring me his ox or his sheep, slaughter them in this place, and then eat. Do not sin against the LORD by eating meat with the blood still in it.’” So that night everyone brought his ox and slaughtered it there. 
09014035	Then Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first time he had built an altar to the LORD. 
09014036	And Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until dawn, leaving no man alive!” “Do what seems good to you,” the troops replied. But the priest said, “We must consult God here.” 
09014037	So Saul inquired of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will You give them into the hand of Israel?” But God did not answer him that day. 
09014038	Therefore Saul said, “Come here, all you leaders of the troops, and let us investigate how this sin has occurred today. 
09014039	As surely as the LORD who saves Israel lives, even if it is my son Jonathan, he must die!” But not one of the troops said a word. 
09014040	Then Saul said to all Israel, “You stand on one side, and I and my son Jonathan will stand on the other side.” “Do what seems good to you,” the troops replied. 
09014041	So Saul said to the LORD, the God of Israel, “Why have You not answered Your servant this day? If the fault is with me or my son Jonathan, respond with Urim, but if the fault is with the men of Israel, respond with Thummim.” And Jonathan and Saul were selected, but the people were cleared of the charge. 
09014042	Then Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan.” And Jonathan was selected. 
09014043	“Tell me what you have done,” Saul commanded him. So Jonathan told him, “I only tasted a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand. And now I must die?” 
09014044	And Saul declared, “May God punish me, and ever so severely, if you, Jonathan, do not surely die!” 
09014045	But the people said to Saul, “Must Jonathan die—he who accomplished such a great deliverance for Israel? Never! As surely as the LORD lives, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground, for with God’s help he has accomplished this today.” So the people rescued Jonathan, and he did not die. 
09014046	Then Saul gave up his pursuit of the Philistines, and the Philistines returned to their own land. 
09014047	After Saul had assumed the kingship over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side—the Moabites, the Ammonites, the Edomites, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he routed them. 
09014048	He fought valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, delivering Israel from the hands of its plunderers. 
09014049	Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchishua. His two daughters were named Merab (his firstborn) and Michal (his younger daughter). 
09014050	His wife’s name was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of his army was Abner, the son of Saul’s uncle Ner. 
09014051	Saul’s father Kish and Abner’s father Ner were sons of Abiel. 
09014052	And the war with the Philistines was fierce for all the days of Saul. So whenever he noticed any strong or brave man, Saul would enlist him. 
09015001	Then Samuel said to Saul, “The LORD sent me to anoint you king over His people Israel. Now therefore, listen to the words of the LORD. 
09015002	This is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘I witnessed what the Amalekites did to the Israelites when they opposed them on their way up from Egypt. 
09015003	Now go and attack the Amalekites and devote to destruction all that belongs to them. Do not spare them, but put to death men and women, children and infants, oxen and sheep, camels and donkeys.’” 
09015004	So Saul summoned the troops and numbered them at Telaim—200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men of Judah. 
09015005	Saul came to the city of Amalek and lay in wait in the valley. 
09015006	And he warned the Kenites, “Since you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt, go on and get away from the Amalekites. Otherwise I will sweep you away with them.” So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites. 
09015007	Then Saul struck down the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to Shur, which is east of Egypt. 
09015008	He captured Agag king of Amalek alive, but devoted all the others to destruction with the sword. 
09015009	Saul and his troops spared Agag, along with the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves and lambs, and the best of everything else. They were unwilling to devote them to destruction, but they devoted to destruction all that was despised and worthless. 
09015010	Then the word of the LORD came to Samuel, saying, 
09015011	“I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned away from following Me and has not carried out My instructions.” And Samuel was distressed and cried out to the LORD all that night. 
09015012	Early in the morning Samuel got up to confront Saul, but he was told, “Saul has gone to Carmel, and behold, he has set up a monument for himself and has turned and gone down to Gilgal.” 
09015013	When Samuel reached him, Saul said to him, “May the LORD bless you. I have carried out the LORD’s instructions.” 
09015014	But Samuel replied, “Then what is this bleating of sheep and lowing of cattle that I hear?” 
09015015	Saul answered, “The troops brought them from the Amalekites; they spared the best sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the LORD your God, but the rest we devoted to destruction.” 
09015016	“Stop!” exclaimed Samuel. “Let me tell you what the LORD said to me last night.” “Tell me,” Saul replied. 
09015017	And Samuel said, “Although you were once small in your own eyes, have you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king over Israel 
09015018	and sent you on a mission, saying, ‘Go and devote to destruction the sinful Amalekites. Fight against them until you have wiped them out.’ 
09015019	So why did you not obey the LORD? Why did you rush upon the plunder and do evil in the sight of the LORD?” 
09015020	“But I did obey the LORD,” Saul replied. “I went on the mission that the LORD gave me. I brought back Agag king of Amalek and devoted the Amalekites to destruction. 
09015021	The troops took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of the things devoted to destruction, in order to sacrifice them to the LORD your God at Gilgal.” 
09015022	But Samuel declared: “Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obedience to His voice? Behold, obedience is better than sacrifice, and attentiveness is better than the fat of rams. 
09015023	For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance is like the wickedness of idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, He has rejected you as king.” 
09015024	Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned; I have transgressed the LORD’s commandment and your instructions, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice. 
09015025	Now therefore, please forgive my sin and return with me so I can worship the LORD.” 
09015026	“I will not return with you,” Samuel replied. “For you have rejected the word of the LORD, and He has rejected you as king over Israel.” 
09015027	As Samuel turned to go, Saul grabbed the hem of his robe, and it tore. 
09015028	So Samuel said to him, “The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to your neighbor who is better than you. 
09015029	Moreover, the Glory of Israel does not lie or change His mind, for He is not a man, that He should change His mind.” 
09015030	“I have sinned,” Saul replied. “Please honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel. Come back with me, so that I may worship the LORD your God.” 
09015031	So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped the LORD. 
09015032	Then Samuel said, “Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites.” Agag came to him cheerfully, for he thought, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.” 
09015033	But Samuel declared: “As your sword has made women childless, so your mother will be childless among women.” And Samuel hacked Agag to pieces before the LORD at Gilgal. 
09015034	Then Samuel went to Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul. 
09015035	And to the day of his death, Samuel never again visited Saul. Samuel mourned for Saul, and the LORD regretted that He had made Saul king over Israel. 
09016001	Now the LORD said to Samuel, “How long are you going to mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and go. I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem, for I have selected from his sons a king for Myself.” 
09016002	“How can I go?” Samuel asked. “Saul will hear of it and kill me!” The LORD answered, “Take a heifer with you and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.’ 
09016003	Then invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you are to do. You are to anoint for Me the one I indicate.” 
09016004	So Samuel did what the LORD had said and went to Bethlehem. When the elders of the town met him, they trembled and asked, “Do you come in peace?” 
09016005	“In peace,” he replied. “I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.” Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice. 
09016006	When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and said, “Surely here before the LORD is His anointed.” 
09016007	But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not consider his appearance or height, for I have rejected him; the LORD does not see as man does. For man sees the outward appearance, but the LORD sees the heart.” 
09016008	Then Jesse called Abinadab and presented him to Samuel, who said, “The LORD has not chosen this one either.” 
09016009	Next Jesse presented Shammah, but Samuel said, “The LORD has not chosen this one either.” 
09016010	Thus Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel told him, “The LORD has not chosen any of these.” 
09016011	And Samuel asked him, “Are these all the sons you have?” “There is still the youngest,” Jesse replied, “but he is tending the sheep.” “Send for him,” Samuel replied. “For we will not sit down to eat until he arrives.” 
09016012	So Jesse sent for his youngest son and brought him in. He was ruddy, with beautiful eyes and a handsome appearance. And the LORD said, “Rise and anoint him, for he is the one.” 
09016013	So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon David from that day forward. Then Samuel set out and went to Ramah. 
09016014	Now the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and a spirit of distress from the LORD began to torment him. 
09016015	Saul’s servants said to him, “Surely a spirit of distress from God is tormenting you. 
09016016	Let our lord command your servants here to seek out someone who can skillfully play the harp. Whenever the spirit of distress from God is upon you, he is to play it, and you will be well.” 
09016017	And Saul commanded his servants, “Find me someone who plays well, and bring him to me.” 
09016018	One of the servants answered, “I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem who knows how to play the harp. He is a mighty man of valor, a warrior, eloquent and handsome, and the LORD is with him.” 
09016019	So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me your son David, who is with the sheep.” 
09016020	And Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine, and one young goat and sent them to Saul with his son David. 
09016021	When David came to Saul and entered his service, Saul loved him very much, and David became his armor-bearer. 
09016022	Then Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, “Let David remain in my service, for I am pleased with him.” 
09016023	And whenever the spirit from God came upon Saul, David would pick up his harp and play. Then Saul would find relief and feel better, and the spirit of distress would depart from him. 
09017001	Now the Philistines gathered their forces for war at Socoh in Judah, and they camped between Socoh and Azekah in Ephes-dammim. 
09017002	Saul and the men of Israel assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah, arraying themselves for battle against the Philistines. 
09017003	The Philistines stood on one hill and the Israelites stood on another, with the valley between them. 
09017004	Then a champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out from the Philistine camp. He was six cubits and a span in height, 
09017005	and he had a bronze helmet on his head. He wore a bronze coat of mail weighing five thousand shekels, 
09017006	and he had armor of bronze on his legs and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders. 
09017007	The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels. In addition, his shield bearer went before him. 
09017008	And Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, “Why do you come out and array yourselves for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose one of your men and have him come down against me. 
09017009	If he is able to fight me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and work for us.” 
09017010	Then the Philistine said, “I defy the ranks of Israel this day! Give me a man to fight!” 
09017011	On hearing the words of the Philistine, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and greatly afraid. 
09017012	Now David was the son of a man named Jesse, an Ephrathite from Bethlehem of Judah who had eight sons. And in the days of Saul, Jesse was old and well along in years. 
09017013	The three older sons of Jesse had followed Saul into battle: The firstborn was Eliab, the second was Abinadab, and the third was Shammah. 
09017014	And David was the youngest. The three oldest had followed Saul, 
09017015	but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father’s sheep in Bethlehem. 
09017016	For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening to take his stand. 
09017017	One day Jesse said to his son David, “Take this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp. 
09017018	Take also these ten portions of cheese to the commander of their unit. Check on the welfare of your brothers and bring back an assurance from them. 
09017019	They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.” 
09017020	So David got up early in the morning, left the flock with a keeper, loaded up, and set out as Jesse had instructed him. He reached the camp as the army was marching out to its position and shouting the battle cry. 
09017021	And Israel and the Philistines arrayed in formation against each other. 
09017022	Then David left his supplies in the care of the quartermaster and ran to the battle line. When he arrived, he asked his brothers how they were doing. 
09017023	And as he was speaking with them, suddenly the champion named Goliath, the Philistine from Gath, came forward from the ranks of the Philistines and shouted his usual words, which David also heard. 
09017024	When all the men of Israel saw Goliath, they fled from him in great fear. 
09017025	Now the men of Israel had been saying, “Do you see how this man keeps coming out to defy Israel? To the man who kills him the king will give great riches. And he will give him his daughter in marriage and exempt his father’s house from taxation in Israel.” 
09017026	David asked the men who were standing with him, “What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Just who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?” 
09017027	The people told him about the offer, saying, “That is what will be done for the man who kills him.” 
09017028	Now when David’s oldest brother Eliab heard him speaking to the men, his anger burned against David. “Why have you come down here?” he asked. “And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and wickedness of heart—you have come down to see the battle!” 
09017029	“What have I done now?” said David. “Was it not just a question?” 
09017030	Then he turned from him toward another and asked about the offer, and those people answered him just as the first ones had answered. 
09017031	Now David’s words were overheard and reported to Saul, who sent for him. 
09017032	And David said to Saul, “Let no man’s heart fail on account of this Philistine. Your servant will go and fight him!” 
09017033	But Saul replied, “You cannot go out against this Philistine to fight him. You are just a boy, and he has been a warrior from his youth.” 
09017034	David replied, “Your servant has been tending his father’s sheep, and whenever a lion or a bear came and carried off a lamb from the flock, 
09017035	I went after it, struck it down, and delivered the lamb from its mouth. If it reared up against me, I would grab it by its fur, strike it down, and kill it. 
09017036	Your servant has killed lions and bears; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, for he has defied the armies of the living God.” 
09017037	David added, “The LORD, who delivered me from the claws of the lion and the bear, will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.” “Go,” said Saul, “and may the LORD be with you.” 
09017038	Then Saul clothed David in his own tunic, put a bronze helmet on his head, and dressed him in armor. 
09017039	David strapped his sword over the tunic and tried to walk, but he was not accustomed to them. “I cannot walk in these,” David said to Saul. “I am not accustomed to them.” So David took them off. 
09017040	And David took his staff in his hand, selected five smooth stones from the brook, and put them in the pouch of his shepherd’s bag. And with his sling in hand, he approached the Philistine. 
09017041	Now the Philistine came closer and closer to David, with his shield-bearer before him. 
09017042	When the Philistine looked and saw David, he despised him because he was just a boy, ruddy and handsome. 
09017043	“Am I a dog,” he said to David, “that you come at me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. 
09017044	“Come here,” he called to David, “and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field!” 
09017045	But David said to the Philistine, “You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD of Hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. 
09017046	This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand. This day I will strike you down, cut off your head, and give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the creatures of the earth. Then the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel. 
09017047	And all those assembled here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves; for the battle is the LORD’s, and He will give all of you into our hands.” 
09017048	As the Philistine started forward to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him. 
09017049	Then David reached into his bag, took out a stone, and slung it, striking the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground. 
09017050	Thus David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him. 
09017051	David ran and stood over him. He grabbed the Philistine’s sword and pulled it from its sheath and killed him, and he cut off his head with the sword. When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran. 
09017052	Then the men of Israel and Judah charged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath and to the gates of Ekron. And the bodies of the Philistines were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron. 
09017053	When the Israelites returned from their pursuit of the Philistines, they plundered their camps. 
09017054	David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, and he put Goliath’s weapons in his own tent. 
09017055	As Saul had watched David going out to confront the Philistine, he said to Abner the commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is this young man?” “As surely as you live, O king,” Abner replied, “I do not know.” 
09017056	“Find out whose son this young man is!” said the king. 
09017057	So when David returned from killing the Philistine, still holding his head in his hand, Abner took him and brought him before Saul. 
09017058	“Whose son are you, young man?” asked Saul. “I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem,” David replied. 
09018001	After David had finished speaking with Saul, the souls of Jonathan and David were knit together, and Jonathan loved him as himself. 
09018002	And from that day Saul kept David with him and did not let him return to his father’s house. 
09018003	Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself. 
09018004	And Jonathan removed the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, his sword, his bow, and his belt. 
09018005	So David marched out and prospered in everything Saul sent him to do, and Saul set him over the men of war. And this was pleasing in the sight of all the people, and of Saul’s officers as well. 
09018006	As the troops were returning home after David had killed the Philistine, the women came out of all the cities of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing, with joyful songs, and with tambourines and other instruments. 
09018007	And as the women danced, they sang out: “Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands.” 
09018008	And Saul was furious and resented this song. “They have ascribed tens of thousands to David,” he said, “but only thousands to me. What more can he have but the kingdom?” 
09018009	And from that day forward Saul kept a jealous eye on David. 
09018010	The next day a spirit of distress sent from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied inside the house while David played the harp as usual. Now Saul was holding a spear, 
09018011	and he hurled it, thinking, “I will pin David to the wall.” But David eluded him twice. 
09018012	So Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with David but had departed from Saul. 
09018013	Therefore Saul sent David away and gave him command of a thousand men. David led the troops out to battle and back, 
09018014	and he continued to prosper in all his ways, because the LORD was with him. 
09018015	When Saul saw that David was very successful, he was afraid of him. 
09018016	But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he was leading them out to battle and back. 
09018017	Then Saul said to David, “Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you in marriage. Only be valiant for me and fight the LORD’s battles.” But Saul was thinking, “I need not raise my hand against him; let the hand of the Philistines be against him.” 
09018018	And David said to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my family or my father’s clan in Israel, that I should become the son-in-law of the king?” 
09018019	So when it was time to give Saul’s daughter Merab to David, she was given in marriage to Adriel of Meholah. 
09018020	Now Saul’s daughter Michal loved David, and when this was reported to Saul, it pleased him. 
09018021	“I will give her to David,” Saul thought, “so that she may be a snare to him, and the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” So Saul said to David, “For a second time now you can be my son-in-law.” 
09018022	Then Saul ordered his servants, “Speak to David privately and tell him, ‘Behold, the king is pleased with you, and all his servants love you. Now therefore, become his son-in-law.’” 
09018023	But when Saul’s servants relayed these words to David, he replied, “Does it seem trivial in your sight to be the son-in-law of the king? I am a poor man and lightly esteemed.” 
09018024	And the servants told Saul what David had said. 
09018025	Saul replied, “Say to David, ‘The king desires no other dowry but a hundred Philistine foreskins as revenge on his enemies.’” But Saul intended to cause David’s death at the hands of the Philistines. 
09018026	When the servants reported these terms to David, he was pleased to become the king’s son-in-law. Before the wedding day arrived, 
09018027	David and his men went out and killed two hundred Philistines. He brought their foreskins and presented them as payment in full to become the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave his daughter Michal to David in marriage. 
09018028	When Saul realized that the LORD was with David and that his daughter Michal loved David, 
09018029	he grew even more afraid of David. So from then on Saul was David’s enemy. 
09018030	Every time the Philistine commanders came out for battle, David was more successful than all of Saul’s officers, so that his name was highly esteemed. 
09019001	Then Saul ordered his son Jonathan and all his servants to kill David. But Jonathan delighted greatly in David, 
09019002	so he warned David, saying, “My father Saul intends to kill you. Be on your guard in the morning; find a secret place and hide there. 
09019003	I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, so I can ask about you. And if I find out anything, I will tell you.” 
09019004	Then Jonathan spoke well of David to his father Saul and said to him, “The king should not sin against his servant David; he has not sinned against you. In fact, his actions have been highly beneficial to you. 
09019005	He took his life in his hands when he struck down the Philistine, and the LORD worked a great salvation for all Israel. You saw it and rejoiced, so why would you sin against innocent blood by killing David for no reason?” 
09019006	Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan and swore an oath: “As surely as the LORD lives, David will not be put to death.” 
09019007	So Jonathan summoned David and told him all these things. Then Jonathan brought David to Saul, and David was with Saul as before. 
09019008	When war broke out again, David went out and fought the Philistines and struck them with such a mighty blow that they fled before him. 
09019009	But as Saul was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, a spirit of distress from the LORD came upon him. While David was playing the harp, 
09019010	Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear. But David eluded him and the spear struck the wall. And David fled and escaped that night. 
09019011	Then Saul sent messengers to David’s house to watch him and kill him in the morning. But David’s wife Michal warned him, “If you do not run for your life tonight, tomorrow you will be dead!” 
09019012	So Michal lowered David from the window, and he ran away and escaped. 
09019013	Then Michal took a household idol and laid it in the bed, placed some goat hair on its head, and covered it with a garment. 
09019014	When Saul sent the messengers to seize David, Michal said, “He is ill.” 
09019015	But Saul sent the messengers back to see David and told them, “Bring him up to me in his bed so I can kill him.” 
09019016	And when the messengers entered, there was the idol in the bed with the goat hair on its head. 
09019017	And Saul said to Michal, “Why did you deceive me like this? You sent my enemy away, and he has escaped!” Michal replied, “He said to me, ‘Help me get away, or I will kill you!’” 
09019018	So David ran away and escaped. And he went to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there. 
09019019	When Saul was told that David was at Naioth in Ramah, 
09019020	he sent messengers to seize him. But when they saw the group of prophets prophesying, with Samuel leading them, the Spirit of God came upon them, and Saul’s messengers also began to prophesy. 
09019021	When this was reported to Saul, he sent more messengers, but they began to prophesy as well. So Saul tried again and sent messengers a third time, and even they began to prophesy. 
09019022	Finally, Saul himself left for Ramah and came to the large cistern at Secu, where he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?” “At Naioth in Ramah,” he was told. 
09019023	So Saul went to Naioth in Ramah. But the Spirit of God came upon even Saul, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth in Ramah. 
09019024	Then Saul stripped off his robes and also prophesied before Samuel. And he collapsed and lay naked all that day and night. That is why it is said, “Is Saul also among the prophets?” 
09020001	Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah. He came to Jonathan and asked, “What have I done? What is my iniquity? How have I sinned against your father, that he wants to take my life?” 
09020002	“Far from it!” Jonathan replied. “You will not die. Indeed, my father does nothing, great or small, without telling me. So why would he hide this matter from me? This cannot be true!” 
09020003	But David again vowed, “Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said, ‘Jonathan must not know of this, or he will be grieved.’ As surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, there is but a step between me and death.” 
09020004	Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you desire, I will do for you.” 
09020005	So David told him, “Look, tomorrow is the New Moon, and I am supposed to dine with the king. Instead, let me go and hide in the field until the third evening from now. 
09020006	If your father misses me at all, tell him, ‘David urgently requested my permission to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown, because there is an annual sacrifice for his whole clan.’ 
09020007	If he says, ‘Good,’ then your servant is safe, but if he is enraged, you will know he has evil intentions. 
09020008	Therefore show kindness to your servant, for you have brought me into a covenant with you before the LORD. If there is iniquity in me, then kill me yourself; why should you bring me to your father?” 
09020009	“Never!” Jonathan replied. “If I ever found out that my father had evil intentions against you, would I not tell you?” 
09020010	Then David asked Jonathan, “Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?” 
09020011	“Come,” he replied, “let us go out to the field.” So the two of them went out into the field, 
09020012	and Jonathan said, “By the LORD, the God of Israel, I will sound out my father by this time tomorrow or the next day. If he is favorable toward you, will I not send for you and tell you? 
09020013	But if my father intends to bring evil on you, then may the LORD punish me, and ever so severely, if I do not tell you and send you on your way in safety. May the LORD be with you, just as He has been with my father. 
09020014	And as long as I live, treat me with the LORD’s loving devotion, that I may not die, 
09020015	and do not ever cut off your loving devotion from my household—not even when the LORD cuts off every one of David’s enemies from the face of the earth.” 
09020016	So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, “May the LORD hold David’s enemies accountable.” 
09020017	And Jonathan had David reaffirm his vow out of love for him, for Jonathan loved David as he loved himself. 
09020018	Then Jonathan said to David, “Tomorrow is the New Moon, and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty. 
09020019	When you have stayed three days, hurry down to the place you hid on the day this trouble began, and remain beside the stone Ezel. 
09020020	I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as if I were aiming at a target. 
09020021	Then I will send a boy and say, ‘Go, find the arrows!’ Now, if I expressly say to him, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you; bring them,’ then come, because as surely as the LORD lives, it is safe for you, and there is no danger. 
09020022	But if I say to the young man, ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you,’ then you must go, for the LORD has sent you away. 
09020023	And as for the matter you and I have discussed, the LORD is a witness between you and me forever.” 
09020024	So David hid in the field, and when the New Moon had come, the king sat down to eat. 
09020025	He sat in his usual place by the wall, opposite Jonathan and beside Abner, but David’s place was empty. 
09020026	Saul said nothing that day because he thought, “Something has happened to David to make him ceremonially unclean—surely he is unclean.” 
09020027	But on the day after the New Moon, the second day, David’s place was still empty, and Saul asked his son Jonathan, “Why hasn’t the son of Jesse come to the meal either yesterday or today?” 
09020028	Jonathan answered, “David urgently requested my permission to go to Bethlehem, 
09020029	saying, ‘Please let me go, because our clan is holding a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has told me to be there. So now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me go and see my brothers.’ That is why he has not come to the king’s table.” 
09020030	Then Saul’s anger burned against Jonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of the mother who bore you? 
09020031	For as long as the son of Jesse lives on this earth, neither you nor your kingdom shall be established. Now send for him and bring him to me, for he must surely die!” 
09020032	“Why must he be put to death?” Jonathan replied. “What has he done?” 
09020033	Then Saul hurled his spear at Jonathan to kill him. So Jonathan knew that his father was determined to kill David. 
09020034	Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger and did not eat any food that second day of the month, for he was grieved by his father’s shameful treatment of David. 
09020035	In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for the appointment with David, and a small boy was with him. 
09020036	He said to the boy, “Run and find the arrows I shoot.” And as the boy ran, Jonathan shot an arrow beyond him. 
09020037	When the boy reached the place where Jonathan’s arrow had fallen, Jonathan called to him, “Isn’t the arrow beyond you?” 
09020038	Then Jonathan cried out, “Hurry! Make haste! Do not delay!” So the boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master. 
09020039	But the boy did not know anything; only Jonathan and David knew the arrangement. 
09020040	Then Jonathan gave his equipment to the boy and said, “Go, take it back to the city.” 
09020041	When the young man had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone, fell facedown, and bowed three times. Then he and Jonathan kissed each other and wept together—though David wept more. 
09020042	And Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, for the two of us have sworn in the name of the LORD, saying, ‘May the LORD be a witness between you and me, and between your descendants and mine forever.’” Then David got up and departed, and Jonathan went back into the city. 
09021001	Then David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. And when Ahimelech met David, he trembled and asked him, “Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?” 
09021002	“The king has given me a mission,” David replied. “He told me no one is to know about the mission on which I am sending you. And I have directed my young men to meet me at a certain place. 
09021003	Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever can be found.” 
09021004	“There is no common bread on hand,” the priest replied, “but there is some consecrated bread—provided that the young men have kept themselves from women.” 
09021005	David answered, “Women have indeed been kept from us, as is usual when I set out. And the bodies of the young men are holy even on common missions. How much more so today!” 
09021006	So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, since there was no bread there but the Bread of the Presence, which had been removed from before the LORD and replaced with hot bread on the day it was taken away. 
09021007	Now one of Saul’s servants was there that day, detained before the LORD. And his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief shepherd for Saul. 
09021008	Then David asked Ahimelech, “Is there not a spear or sword on hand here? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s mission was urgent.” 
09021009	The priest replied, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here; it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want, you may take it. For there is no other but this one here.” And David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.” 
09021010	That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath. 
09021011	But the servants of Achish said to him, “Is this not David, the king of the land? Did they not sing about him in their dances, saying: ‘Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands’?” 
09021012	Now David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish the king of Gath. 
09021013	So he changed his behavior before them and feigned madness in their hands; he scratched on the doors of the gate and let his saliva run down his beard. 
09021014	Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you can see that the man is insane! Why have you brought him to me? 
09021015	Am I in need of madmen, that you have brought this man to rave in my presence? Must this man come into my house?” 
09022001	So David left Gath and took refuge in the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and the rest of his father’s household heard about it, they went down to him there. 
09022002	And all who were distressed or indebted or discontented rallied around him, and he became their leader. About four hundred men were with him. 
09022003	From there David went to Mizpeh of Moab, where he said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and mother stay with you until I learn what God will do for me.” 
09022004	So he left them in the care of the king of Moab, and they stayed with him the whole time David was in the stronghold. 
09022005	Then the prophet Gad said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold. Depart and go into the land of Judah.” So David left and went to the forest of Hereth. 
09022006	Soon Saul learned that David and his men had been discovered. At that time Saul was sitting under the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah, with his spear in hand and all his servants standing around him. 
09022007	Then Saul said to his servants, “Listen, men of Benjamin! Is the son of Jesse giving all of you fields and vineyards and making you commanders of thousands or hundreds? 
09022008	Is that why all of you have conspired against me? Not one of you told me that my own son had made a covenant with the son of Jesse. Not one of you has shown concern for me or revealed to me that my son has stirred up my own servant to lie in wait against me, as is the case today.” 
09022009	But Doeg the Edomite, who had stationed himself with Saul’s servants, answered: “I saw the son of Jesse come to Ahimelech son of Ahitub at Nob. 
09022010	Ahimelech inquired of the LORD for him and gave him provisions. He also gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.” 
09022011	Then the king sent messengers to summon Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and his father’s whole family, who were priests at Nob. And all of them came to the king. 
09022012	“Listen now, son of Ahitub,” said Saul. “Here I am, my lord,” he replied. 
09022013	And Saul asked him, “Why have you and the son of Jesse conspired against me? You gave him bread and a sword and inquired of God for him so that he could rise up against me to lie in wait, as he is doing today.” 
09022014	Ahimelech answered the king, “Who among all your servants is as faithful as David, the king’s son-in-law, the captain of your bodyguard and honored in your house? 
09022015	Was that day the first time I inquired of God for him? Far be it from me! Let not the king accuse your servant or any of my father’s household, for your servant knew nothing of this whole affair—not in part or in whole.” 
09022016	But the king replied, “You will surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father’s house!” 
09022017	Then the king ordered the guards at his side, “Turn and kill the priests of the LORD, because they too sided with David. For they knew he was fleeing, but they did not tell me.” But the king’s servants would not lift a hand to strike the priests of the LORD. 
09022018	So the king ordered Doeg, “You turn and strike down the priests!” And Doeg the Edomite turned and struck down the priests himself. On that day he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod. 
09022019	He also put to the sword Nob, the city of the priests, with its men and women, children and infants, oxen, donkeys, and sheep. 
09022020	But one of the sons of Ahimelech son of Ahitub escaped. His name was Abiathar, and he fled to David. 
09022021	And Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD. 
09022022	Then David said to Abiathar, “I knew that Doeg the Edomite was there that day, and that he was sure to tell Saul. I myself am responsible for the lives of everyone in your father’s house. 
09022023	Stay with me; do not be afraid, for he who seeks your life is seeking mine as well. You will be safe with me.” 
09023001	Now it was reported to David, “Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and looting the threshing floors.” 
09023002	So David inquired of the LORD, “Should I go and attack these Philistines?” And the LORD said to David, “Go and attack the Philistines and save Keilah.” 
09023003	But David’s men said to him, “Look, we are afraid here in Judah; how much more if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?” 
09023004	Once again, David inquired of the LORD, and the LORD answered him: “Go at once to Keilah, for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.” 
09023005	Then David and his men went to Keilah, fought against the Philistines, and carried off their livestock, striking them with a mighty blow. So David saved the people of Keilah. 
09023006	(Now Abiathar son of Ahimelech had brought the ephod with him when he fled to David at Keilah.) 
09023007	When Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah, he said, “God has delivered him into my hand, for he has trapped himself by entering a town with gates and bars.” 
09023008	Then Saul summoned all his troops to go to war at Keilah and besiege David and his men. 
09023009	When David learned that Saul was plotting evil against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod.” 
09023010	And David said, “O LORD, God of Israel, Your servant has heard that Saul intends to come to Keilah and destroy the city on my account. 
09023011	Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as Your servant has heard? O LORD, God of Israel, please tell Your servant.” “He will,” said the LORD. 
09023012	So David asked, “Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul?” “They will,” said the LORD. 
09023013	Then David and his men, about six hundred strong, set out and departed from Keilah, moving from place to place. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he declined to go forth. 
09023014	And David stayed in the wilderness strongholds and in the hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph. Day after day Saul searched for him, but God would not deliver David into his hand. 
09023015	While David was in Horesh in the Wilderness of Ziph, he saw that Saul had come out to take his life. 
09023016	And Saul’s son Jonathan came to David in Horesh and strengthened his hand in God, 
09023017	saying, “Do not be afraid, for my father Saul will never lay a hand on you. And you will be king over Israel, and I will be your second-in-command. Even my father Saul knows this is true.” 
09023018	So the two of them made a covenant before the LORD. And David remained in Horesh, while Jonathan went home. 
09023019	Then the Ziphites came up to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah south of Jeshimon? 
09023020	Now, O king, come down whenever your soul desires, and we will be responsible for delivering him into your hand.” 
09023021	“May you be blessed by the LORD,” replied Saul, “for you have had compassion on me. 
09023022	Please go and prepare further. Investigate and watch carefully where he goes and who has seen him there, for I am told that he is extremely cunning. 
09023023	Observe and find out all the places where he hides. Then come back to me with certainty, and I will go with you. If he is in the land, I will search him out among all the clans of Judah.” 
09023024	So they set out and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon in the Arabah south of Jeshimon, 
09023025	and Saul and his men went to seek him. When David was told about it, he went down to the rock and stayed in the Wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard of this, he pursued David there. 
09023026	Saul was proceeding along one side of the mountain, and David and his men along the other side. Even though David was hurrying to get away, Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them. 
09023027	Then a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Come quickly, for the Philistines have raided the land!” 
09023028	So Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to meet the Philistines. That is why that place is called Sela-hammahlekoth. 
09023029	And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of En-gedi. 
09024001	After Saul had returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, “David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.” 
09024002	So Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and went to look for David and his men in the region of the Rocks of the Wild Goats. 
09024003	Soon Saul came to the sheepfolds along the road, where there was a cave, and he went in to relieve himself. And David and his men were hiding in the recesses of the cave. 
09024004	So David’s men said to him, “This is the day about which the LORD said to you, ‘Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, that you may do with him as you wish.’” Then David crept up and stealthily cut off a corner of Saul’s robe. 
09024005	Afterward, David’s conscience was stricken because he had cut off the corner of Saul’s robe. 
09024006	So he said to his men, “The LORD forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the LORD’s anointed. May I never lift my hand against him, since he is the LORD’s anointed.” 
09024007	With these words David restrained his men, and he did not let them rise up against Saul. Then Saul left the cave and went on his way. 
09024008	After that, David got up, went out of the cave, and called out to Saul, “My lord the king!” When Saul looked behind him, David bowed facedown in reverence 
09024009	and said to Saul, “Why do you listen to the words of men who say, ‘Look, David intends to harm you’? 
09024010	Behold, this day you have seen with your own eyes that the LORD delivered you into my hand in the cave. I was told to kill you, but I spared you and said, ‘I will not lift my hand against my lord, since he is the LORD’s anointed.’ 
09024011	See, my father, look at the corner of your robe in my hand. For I cut it off, but I did not kill you. Know and see that there is no evil or rebellion in my hands. I have not sinned against you, even though you are hunting me down to take my life. 
09024012	May the LORD judge between you and me, and may the LORD take vengeance on you, but my hand will never be against you. 
09024013	As the old proverb says, ‘Wickedness proceeds from the wicked.’ But my hand will never be against you. 
09024014	Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea? 
09024015	May the LORD be our judge and decide between you and me. May He take notice and plead my case and deliver me from your hand.” 
09024016	When David had finished saying these things, Saul called back, “Is that your voice, David my son?” Then Saul wept aloud 
09024017	and said to David, “You are more righteous than I, for you have rewarded me with good, though I have rewarded you with evil. 
09024018	And you have declared this day how you have treated me well, for when the LORD delivered me into your hand, you did not kill me. 
09024019	When a man finds his enemy, does he let him go away unharmed? May the LORD reward you with good for what you have done for me this day. 
09024020	Now I know for sure that you will be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands. 
09024021	So now, swear to me by the LORD that you will not cut off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father’s house.” 
09024022	So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold. 
09025001	When Samuel died, all Israel gathered to mourn for him; and they buried him at his home in Ramah. Then David set out and went down to the Wilderness of Paran. 
09025002	Now there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel. He was a very wealthy man with a thousand goats and three thousand sheep, which he was shearing in Carmel. 
09025003	His name was Nabal, and his wife’s name was Abigail. She was an intelligent and beautiful woman, but her husband, a Calebite, was harsh and evil in his dealings. 
09025004	While David was in the wilderness, he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep. 
09025005	So David sent ten young men and instructed them, “Go up to Nabal at Carmel. Greet him in my name 
09025006	and say to him, ‘Long life to you, and peace to you and to your house and to all that belongs to you. 
09025007	Now I hear that it is time for shearing. When your shepherds were with us, we did not harass them, and nothing of theirs was missing the whole time they were in Carmel. 
09025008	Ask your young men, and they will tell you. So let my young men find favor with you, for we have come on the day of a feast. Please give whatever you can spare to your servants and to your son David.’” 
09025009	When David’s young men arrived, they relayed all these words to Nabal on behalf of David. Then they waited. 
09025010	But Nabal asked them, “Who is David? Who is this son of Jesse? Many servants these days are breaking away from their masters. 
09025011	Why should I take my bread and water and the meat I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give them to these men whose origin I do not know?” 
09025012	So David’s men turned around and went back, and they relayed to him all these words. 
09025013	And David said to his men, “Strap on your swords!” So David and all his men strapped on their swords, and about four hundred men followed David, while two hundred stayed with the supplies. 
09025014	Meanwhile, one of Nabal’s young men informed Nabal’s wife Abigail, “Look, David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master, but he screamed at them. 
09025015	Yet these men were very good to us. When we were in the field, we were not harassed, and nothing of ours went missing the whole time we lived among them. 
09025016	They were a wall around us, both day and night, the whole time we were herding our sheep near them. 
09025017	Now consider carefully what you must do, because disaster looms over our master and all his household. For he is such a scoundrel that nobody can speak to him!” 
09025018	Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five butchered sheep, five seahs of roasted grain, a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs. She loaded them on donkeys 
09025019	and said to her young men, “Go ahead of me. I will be right behind you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal. 
09025020	As Abigail came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, she saw David and his men coming down toward her, and she met them. 
09025021	Now David had just said, “In vain I have protected all that belonged to this man in the wilderness. Nothing that belongs to him has gone missing, yet he has paid me back evil for good. 
09025022	May God punish David, and ever so severely, if I let one male belonging to Nabal survive until morning.” 
09025023	When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off the donkey, fell facedown, and bowed before him. 
09025024	She fell at his feet and said, “My lord, may the blame be on me alone, but please let your servant speak to you; hear the words of your servant. 
09025025	My lord should pay no attention to this scoundrel Nabal, for he lives up to his name: His name means Fool, and folly accompanies him. I, your servant, did not see my lord’s young men whom you sent. 
09025026	Now, my lord, as surely as the LORD lives and you yourself live, since the LORD has held you back from bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hand, may your enemies and those who seek harm for my lord be like Nabal. 
09025027	Now let this gift your servant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who follow you. 
09025028	Please forgive your servant’s offense, for the LORD will surely make a lasting dynasty for my lord, because he fights the LORD’s battles. May no evil be found in you as long as you live. 
09025029	And should someone pursue you and seek your life, then the life of my lord will be bound securely by the LORD your God in the bundle of the living. But He shall fling away the lives of your enemies like stones from a sling. 
09025030	When the LORD has done for my lord all the good He promised, and when He has appointed you ruler over Israel, 
09025031	then my lord will have no remorse or guilt of conscience over needless bloodshed and revenge. And when the LORD has dealt well with my lord, may you remember your servant.” 
09025032	Then David said to Abigail, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who sent you to meet me this day! 
09025033	Blessed is your discernment, and blessed are you, because today you kept me from bloodshed and from avenging myself by my own hand. 
09025034	Otherwise, as surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, who has restrained me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, then surely no male belonging to Nabal would have been left alive by morning light.” 
09025035	Then David accepted from her hand what she had brought him, and he said to her, “Go home in peace. See, I have heeded your voice and granted your request.” 
09025036	When Abigail returned to Nabal, there he was in the house, holding a feast fit for a king, in high spirits and very drunk. So she told him nothing until morning light. 
09025037	In the morning when Nabal was sober, his wife told him about these events, and his heart failed within him, and he became like a stone. 
09025038	About ten days later, the LORD struck Nabal dead. 
09025039	On hearing that Nabal was dead, David said, “Blessed be the LORD, who has upheld my cause against the reproach of Nabal and has restrained His servant from evil. For the LORD has brought the wickedness of Nabal down upon his own head.” Then David sent word to Abigail, asking her to become his wife. 
09025040	When his servants came to Abigail at Carmel, they said, “David has sent us to take you as his wife.” 
09025041	She arose, bowed facedown, and said, “Here is your servant, ready to serve and to wash the feet of my lord’s servants.” 
09025042	So Abigail hurried and got on a donkey, and attended by five of her maidens, she followed David’s messengers and became his wife. 
09025043	David had also married Ahinoam of Jezreel. So she and Abigail were both his wives. 
09025044	But Saul had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Palti son of Laish, who was from Gallim. 
09026001	Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Is not David hiding on the hill of Hachilah, opposite Jeshimon?” 
09026002	So Saul, accompanied by three thousand chosen men of Israel, went down to the Wilderness of Ziph to search for David there. 
09026003	Saul camped beside the road at the hill of Hachilah opposite Jeshimon, but David was living in the wilderness. When he realized that Saul had followed him there, 
09026004	David sent out spies to verify that Saul had arrived. 
09026005	Then David set out and went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw the place where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the general of his army, had lain down. Saul was lying inside the inner circle of the camp, with the troops camped around him. 
09026006	And David asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, “Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?” “I will go with you,” answered Abishai. 
09026007	That night David and Abishai came to the troops, and Saul was lying there asleep in the inner circle of the camp, with his spear stuck in the ground by his head. And Abner and the troops were lying around him. 
09026008	Abishai said to David, “Today God has delivered your enemy into your hand. Now, therefore, please let me thrust the spear through him into the ground with one stroke. I will not need to strike him twice!” 
09026009	But David said to Abishai, “Do not destroy him, for who can extend a hand against the LORD’s anointed and be guiltless?” 
09026010	David added, “As surely as the LORD lives, the LORD Himself will strike him down; either his day will come and he will die, or he will go into battle and perish. 
09026011	But the LORD forbid that I should extend my hand against the LORD’s anointed. Instead, take the spear and water jug by his head, and let us go.” 
09026012	So David took the spear and water jug by Saul’s head, and they departed. No one saw them or knew about it, nor did anyone wake up; they all remained asleep, because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen on them. 
09026013	Then David crossed to the other side and stood atop the mountain at a distance; there was a wide gulf between them. 
09026014	And David shouted to the troops and to Abner son of Ner, “Will you not answer me, Abner?” “Who are you who calls to the king?” Abner replied. 
09026015	So David said to Abner, “You are a man, aren’t you? And who in Israel is your equal? Why then did you not protect your lord the king when one of the people came to destroy him? 
09026016	This thing you have done is not good. As surely as the LORD lives, all of you deserve to die, since you did not protect your lord, the LORD’s anointed. Now look around. Where are the king’s spear and water jug that were by his head?” 
09026017	Then Saul recognized David’s voice and asked, “Is that your voice, David my son?” “It is my voice, my lord and king,” David said. 
09026018	And he continued, “Why is my lord pursuing his servant? What have I done? What evil is in my hand? 
09026019	Now please, may my lord the king hear the words of his servant: If the LORD has stirred you up against me, then may He accept an offering. But if men have done it, may they be cursed in the presence of the LORD! For today they have driven me away from sharing in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, ‘Go, serve other gods.’ 
09026020	So do not let my blood fall to the ground far from the presence of the LORD. For the king of Israel has come out to look for a flea, like one who hunts a partridge in the mountains.” 
09026021	Then Saul replied, “I have sinned. Come back, David my son. I will never harm you again, because today you considered my life precious. I have played the fool and have committed a grave error!” 
09026022	“Here is the king’s spear,” David answered. “Let one of the young men come over and get it. 
09026023	May the LORD repay every man for his righteousness and faithfulness. For the LORD delivered you into my hand today, but I would not extend my hand against the LORD’s anointed. 
09026024	As surely as I valued your life today, so may the LORD value my life and rescue me from all trouble.” 
09026025	Saul said to him, “May you be blessed, David my son. You will accomplish great things and will surely prevail.” So David went on his way, and Saul returned home. 
09027001	David, however, said to himself, “One of these days now I will be swept away by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will stop searching for me all over Israel, and I will slip out of his hand.” 
09027002	So David set out with his six hundred men and went to Achish son of Maoch, the king of Gath. 
09027003	David and his men settled in Gath with Achish. Each man had his family with him, and David had his two wives: Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, the widow of Nabal. 
09027004	And when Saul learned that David had fled to Gath, he no longer searched for him. 
09027005	Then David said to Achish, “If I have found favor in your eyes, let me be assigned a place in one of the outlying towns, so I can live there. For why should your servant live in the royal city with you?” 
09027006	That day Achish gave him Ziklag, and to this day it still belongs to the kings of Judah. 
09027007	And the time that David lived in Philistine territory amounted to a year and four months. 
09027008	Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites. (From ancient times these people had inhabited the land extending to Shur and Egypt.) 
09027009	Whenever David attacked a territory, he did not leave a man or woman alive, but he took the flocks and herds, the donkeys, camels, and clothing. Then he would return to Achish, 
09027010	who would ask him, “What have you raided today?” And David would reply, “The Negev of Judah,” or “The Negev of Jerahmeel,” or “The Negev of the Kenites.” 
09027011	David did not leave a man or woman alive to be brought to Gath, for he said, “Otherwise they will report us, saying, ‘This is what David did.’” And this was David’s custom the whole time he lived in Philistine territory. 
09027012	So Achish trusted David, thinking, “Since he has made himself an utter stench to his people Israel, he will be my servant forever.” 
09028001	Now in those days the Philistines gathered their forces for warfare against Israel. So Achish said to David, “You must understand that you and your men are to go out to battle with me.” 
09028002	David replied, “Then you will come to know what your servant can do.” “Very well,” said Achish. “I will make you my bodyguard for life.” 
09028003	Now by this time Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had removed the mediums and spiritists from the land. 
09028004	The Philistines gathered together and camped at Shunem, while Saul gathered all Israel and camped at Gilboa. 
09028005	When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid and trembled violently. 
09028006	He inquired of the LORD, but the LORD did not answer him by dreams or Urim or prophets. 
09028007	Then Saul said to his servants, “Find me a woman who is a medium, so I can go and consult her.” “There is a medium at Endor,” his servants replied. 
09028008	So Saul disguised himself by putting on different clothes, and he set out with two of his men. They came to the woman at night, and Saul said, “Consult a spirit for me. Bring up for me the one I name.” 
09028009	But the woman replied, “Surely you know what Saul has done, how he has killed the mediums and spiritists in the land. Why have you set a trap to get me killed?” 
09028010	Then Saul swore to her by the LORD: “As surely as the LORD lives, no punishment shall come upon you for this.” 
09028011	“Whom shall I bring up for you?” the woman asked. “Bring up Samuel,” he replied. 
09028012	But when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out in a loud voice and said to Saul, “Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!” 
09028013	“Do not be afraid,” the king replied. “What do you see?” “I see a god coming up out of the earth,” the woman answered. 
09028014	“What does he look like?” asked Saul. “An old man is coming up,” she replied. “And he is wearing a robe.” So Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed facedown in reverence. 
09028015	Then Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” “I am deeply distressed,” replied Saul. “The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has turned away from me. He no longer answers me, either by prophets or by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what to do.” 
09028016	“Why do you consult me,” asked Samuel, “since the LORD has turned away from you and become your enemy? 
09028017	He has done exactly what He spoke through me: The LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor David. 
09028018	Because you did not obey the LORD or carry out His burning anger against Amalek, the LORD has done this to you today. 
09028019	Moreover, the LORD will deliver Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. And the LORD will deliver the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.” 
09028020	Immediately Saul fell flat on the ground, terrified by the words of Samuel. And his strength was gone, because he had not eaten anything all that day and night. 
09028021	When the woman came to Saul and saw how distraught he was, she said to him, “Look, your maidservant has obeyed your voice. I took my life in my hands and did as you told me. 
09028022	Now please listen to your servant and let me set a morsel of bread before you so you may eat and have the strength to go on your way.” 
09028023	Saul refused, saying, “I will not eat.” But his servants joined the woman in urging him, and he heeded their voice. He got up from the ground and sat on the bed. 
09028024	The woman had a fattened calf at her house, and she quickly slaughtered it. She also took flour, kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread. 
09028025	She served it to Saul and his servants, and they ate. And that night they got up and left. 
09029001	Now the Philistines brought all their forces together at Aphek, while Israel camped by the spring in Jezreel. 
09029002	As the Philistine leaders marched out with their units of hundreds and thousands, David and his men marched behind them with Achish. 
09029003	Then the commanders of the Philistines asked, “What about these Hebrews?” Achish replied, “Is this not David, the servant of King Saul of Israel? He has been with me all these days, even years, and from the day he defected until today I have found no fault in him.” 
09029004	But the commanders of the Philistines were angry with Achish and told him, “Send that man back and let him return to the place you assigned him. He must not go down with us into battle only to become our adversary during the war. What better way for him to regain the favor of his master than with the heads of our men? 
09029005	Is this not the David about whom they sing in their dances: ‘Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands’?” 
09029006	So Achish summoned David and told him, “As surely as the LORD lives, you have been upright, and it seems right in my sight that you should march in and out with me in the army, because I have found no fault in you from the day you came to me until this day. But you are not good in the sight of the leaders. 
09029007	Therefore turn back now and go in peace, so that you will not do anything to displease the leaders of the Philistines.” 
09029008	“But what have I done?” David replied. “What have you found against your servant, from the day I came to you until today, to keep me from going along to fight against the enemies of my lord the king?” 
09029009	Achish replied, “I know that you are as pleasing in my sight as an angel of God. But the commanders of the Philistines have said, ‘He must not go into battle with us.’ 
09029010	Now then, get up early in the morning, along with your master’s servants who came with you, and go as soon as it is light.” 
09029011	So David and his men got up early in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel. 
09030001	On the third day David and his men arrived in Ziklag, and the Amalekites had raided the Negev, attacked Ziklag, and burned it down. 
09030002	They had taken captive the women and all who were there, both young and old. They had not killed anyone, but had carried them off as they went on their way. 
09030003	When David and his men came to the city, they found it burned down and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive. 
09030004	So David and the troops with him lifted up their voices and wept until they had no strength left to weep. 
09030005	David’s two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel, had been taken captive. 
09030006	And David was greatly distressed because the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of every man grieved for his sons and daughters. But David found strength in the LORD his God. 
09030007	Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Bring me the ephod.” So Abiathar brought it to him, 
09030008	and David inquired of the LORD: “Should I pursue these raiders? Will I overtake them?” “Pursue them,” the LORD replied, “for you will surely overtake them and rescue the captives.” 
09030009	So David and his six hundred men went to the Brook of Besor, where some stayed behind 
09030010	because two hundred men were too exhausted to cross the brook. But David and four hundred men continued in pursuit. 
09030011	Now his men found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David. They gave the man water to drink and food to eat— 
09030012	a piece of a fig cake and two clusters of raisins. So he ate and was revived, for he had not had any food or water for three days and three nights. 
09030013	Then David asked him, “To whom do you belong, and where are you from?” “I am an Egyptian,” he replied, “the slave of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me three days ago when I fell ill. 
09030014	We raided the Negev of the Cherethites, the territory of Judah, and the Negev of Caleb, and we burned down Ziklag.” 
09030015	“Will you lead me to these raiders?” David asked. And the man replied, “Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or deliver me into the hand of my master, and I will lead you to them.” 
09030016	So he led David down, and there were the Amalekites spread out over all the land, eating, drinking, and celebrating the great amount of plunder they had taken from the land of the Philistines and the land of Judah. 
09030017	And David struck them down from twilight until the evening of the next day. Not a man escaped, except four hundred young men who fled, riding off on camels. 
09030018	So David recovered everything the Amalekites had taken, including his two wives. 
09030019	Nothing was missing, young or old, son or daughter, or any of the plunder the Amalekites had taken. David brought everything back. 
09030020	And he took all the flocks and herds, which his men drove ahead of the other livestock, calling out, “This is David’s plunder!” 
09030021	When David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow him and who were left behind at the Brook of Besor, they came out to meet him and the troops with him. As David approached the men, he greeted them, 
09030022	but all the wicked and worthless men among those who had gone with David said, “Because they did not go with us, we will not share with them the plunder we recovered, except for each man’s wife and children. They may take them and go.” 
09030023	But David said, “My brothers, you must not do this with what the LORD has given us. He has protected us and delivered into our hands the raiders who came against us. 
09030024	Who will listen to your proposal? The share of the one who went to battle will match the share of the one who stayed with the supplies. They will share alike.” 
09030025	And so it has been from that day forward. David established this statute and ordinance for Israel to this very day. 
09030026	When David arrived in Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to his friends, the elders of Judah, saying, “Here is a gift for you from the plunder of the LORD’s enemies.” 
09030027	He sent gifts to those in Bethel, Ramoth Negev, and Jattir; 
09030028	to those in Aroer, Siphmoth, and Eshtemoa; 
09030029	to those in Racal and in the cities of the Jerahmeelites and Kenites; 
09030030	to those in Hormah, Bor-ashan, and Athach; 
09030031	and to those in Hebron and in all the places where David and his men had roamed. 
09031001	Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled before them, and many fell slain on Mount Gilboa. 
09031002	The Philistines hotly pursued Saul and his sons, and they killed Saul’s sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua. 
09031003	When the battle intensified against Saul, the archers overtook him and wounded him critically. 
09031004	Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and run me through with it, or these uncircumcised men will come and run me through and torture me!” But his armor-bearer was terrified and refused to do it. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it. 
09031005	When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his own sword and died with him. 
09031006	So Saul, his three sons, his armor-bearer, and all his men died together that same day. 
09031007	When the Israelites along the valley and those on the other side of the Jordan saw that the army of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their cities and ran away. So the Philistines came and occupied their cities. 
09031008	The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 
09031009	They cut off Saul’s head, stripped off his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news in the temples of their idols and among their people. 
09031010	They put his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths and hung his body on the wall of Beth-shan. 
09031011	When the people of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, 
09031012	all their men of valor set out, journeyed all night, and retrieved the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth-shan. When they arrived at Jabesh, they burned the bodies there. 
09031013	Then they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and they fasted seven days. 
10001001	After the death of Saul, David returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag two days. 
10001002	On the third day a man with torn clothes and dust on his head arrived from Saul’s camp. When he came to David, he fell to the ground to pay him homage. 
10001003	“Where have you come from?” David asked. “I have escaped from the Israelite camp,” he replied. 
10001004	“What was the outcome?” David asked. “Please tell me.” “The troops fled from the battle,” he replied. “Many of them fell and died. And Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.” 
10001005	Then David asked the young man who had brought him the report, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?” 
10001006	“I happened to be on Mount Gilboa,” he replied, “and there was Saul, leaning on his spear, with the chariots and the cavalry closing in on him. 
10001007	When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me, and I answered, ‘Here I am!’ 
10001008	‘Who are you?’ he asked. So I told him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’ 
10001009	Then he begged me, ‘Stand over me and kill me, for agony has seized me, but my life still lingers.’ 
10001010	So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.” 
10001011	Then David took hold of his own clothes and tore them, and all the men who were with him did the same. 
10001012	They mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the people of the LORD and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword. 
10001013	And David inquired of the young man who had brought him the report, “Where are you from?” “I am the son of a foreigner,” he answered. “I am an Amalekite.” 
10001014	So David asked him, “Why were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the LORD’s anointed?” 
10001015	Then David summoned one of the young men and said, “Go, execute him!” So the young man struck him down, and he died. 
10001016	For David had said to the Amalekite, “Your blood be on your own head because your own mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I killed the LORD’s anointed.’” 
10001017	Then David took up this lament for Saul and his son Jonathan, 
10001018	and he ordered that the sons of Judah be taught the Song of the Bow. It is written in the Book of Jashar: 
10001019	“Your glory, O Israel, lies slain on your heights. How the mighty have fallen! 
10001020	Tell it not in Gath; proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, and the daughters of the uncircumcised exult. 
10001021	O mountains of Gilboa, may you have no dew or rain, no fields yielding offerings of grain. For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul, no longer anointed with oil. 
10001022	From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not retreat, and the sword of Saul did not return empty. 
10001023	Saul and Jonathan, beloved and delightful in life, were not divided in death. They were swifter than eagles; they were stronger than lions. 
10001024	O daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and luxury, who decked your garments with ornaments of gold. 
10001025	How the mighty have fallen in the thick of battle! Jonathan lies slain on your heights. 
10001026	I grieve for you, Jonathan, my brother. You were delightful to me; your love to me was extraordinary, surpassing the love of women. 
10001027	How the mighty have fallen, and the weapons of war have perished!” 
10002001	Some time later, David inquired of the LORD, “Should I go up to one of the towns of Judah?” “Go up,” the LORD answered. Then David asked, “Where should I go?” “To Hebron,” replied the LORD. 
10002002	So David went there with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel. 
10002003	David also took the men who were with him, each with his household, and they settled in the towns near Hebron. 
10002004	Then the men of Judah came to Hebron, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, “It was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul.” 
10002005	So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead to tell them, “The LORD bless you, because you showed this kindness to Saul your lord when you buried him. 
10002006	Now may the LORD show you loving devotion and faithfulness, and I will also show you the same favor because you have done this. 
10002007	Now then, be strong and courageous, for though Saul your lord is dead, the house of Judah has anointed me as their king.” 
10002008	Meanwhile, Abner son of Ner, the commander of Saul’s army, took Saul’s son Ish-bosheth, moved him to Mahanaim, 
10002009	and made him king over Gilead, Asher, Jezreel, Ephraim, and Benjamin—over all Israel. 
10002010	Saul’s son Ish-bosheth was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned for two years. The house of Judah, however, followed David. 
10002011	And the length of time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months. 
10002012	One day Abner son of Ner and the servants of Ish-bosheth son of Saul marched out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. 
10002013	So Joab son of Zeruiah and the servants of David marched out and met them by the pool of Gibeon. And the two groups took up positions on opposite sides of the pool. 
10002014	Then Abner said to Joab, “Let us have the young men get up and compete before us.” “Let them get up,” Joab replied. 
10002015	So they got up and were counted off—twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth son of Saul, and twelve for David. 
10002016	Then each man grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his sword into his opponent’s side, and they all fell together. So this place, which is in Gibeon, is called Helkath-hazzurim. 
10002017	The battle that day was intense, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated by the servants of David. 
10002018	The three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Now Asahel was fleet of foot like a wild gazelle, 
10002019	and he chased Abner, not turning to the right or to the left in his pursuit. 
10002020	And Abner glanced back and said, “Is that you, Asahel?” “It is,” Asahel replied. 
10002021	So Abner told him, “Turn to your right or to your left, seize one of the young men, and take his equipment for yourself.” But Asahel would not stop chasing him. 
10002022	Once again, Abner warned Asahel, “Stop chasing me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How could I show my face to your brother Joab?” 
10002023	But Asahel refused to turn away. So Abner thrust the butt of his spear into his stomach, and it came out his back, and he fell dead on the spot. And every man paused when he came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died. 
10002024	But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. By sunset, they had gone as far as the hill of Ammah opposite Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon. 
10002025	The Benjamites rallied to Abner, formed a single unit, and took their stand atop a hill. 
10002026	Then Abner called out to Joab: “Must the sword devour forever? Do you not realize that this will only end in bitterness? How long before you tell the troops to stop pursuing their brothers?” 
10002027	“As surely as God lives,” Joab replied, “if you had not spoken up, the troops would have continued pursuing their brothers until morning.” 
10002028	So Joab blew the ram’s horn, and all the troops stopped; they no longer pursued Israel or continued to fight. 
10002029	And all that night Abner and his men marched through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, marched all morning, and arrived at Mahanaim. 
10002030	When Joab returned from pursuing Abner, he gathered all the troops. In addition to Asahel, nineteen of David’s servants were missing, 
10002031	but they had struck down 360 Benjamites who were with Abner. 
10002032	And they took Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb in Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night and reached Hebron at daybreak. 
10003001	Now the war between the house of Saul and the house of David was protracted. And David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker. 
10003002	And sons were born to David in Hebron: His firstborn was Amnon, by Ahinoam of Jezreel; 
10003003	his second was Chileab, by Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; his third was Absalom, the son of Maacah daughter of King Talmai of Geshur; 
10003004	his fourth was Adonijah, the son of Haggith; his fifth was Shephatiah, the son of Abital; 
10003005	and his sixth was Ithream, by David’s wife Eglah. These sons were born to David in Hebron. 
10003006	During the war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner had continued to strengthen his position in the house of Saul. 
10003007	Now Saul had a concubine named Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. So Ish-bosheth questioned Abner, “Why did you sleep with my father’s concubine?” 
10003008	Abner was furious over Ish-bosheth’s accusation. “Am I the head of a dog that belongs to Judah?” he asked. “All this time I have been loyal to the house of your father Saul, to his brothers, and to his friends. I have not delivered you into the hand of David, but now you accuse me of wrongdoing with this woman! 
10003009	May God punish Abner, and ever so severely, if I do not do for David what the LORD has sworn to him: 
10003010	to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and to establish the throne of David over Israel and Judah, from Dan to Beersheba.” 
10003011	And for fear of Abner, Ish-bosheth did not dare to say another word to him. 
10003012	Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to say to David, “To whom does the land belong? Make your covenant with me, and surely my hand will be with you to bring all Israel over to you.” 
10003013	“Good,” replied David, “I will make a covenant with you. But there is one thing I require of you: Do not appear before me unless you bring Saul’s daughter Michal when you come to see me.” 
10003014	Then David sent messengers to say to Ish-bosheth son of Saul, “Give me back my wife, Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for a hundred Philistine foreskins.” 
10003015	So Ish-bosheth sent and took Michal from her husband Paltiel son of Laish. 
10003016	Her husband followed her, weeping all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go back.” So he returned home. 
10003017	Now Abner conferred with the elders of Israel and said, “In the past you sought David as your king. 
10003018	Now take action, because the LORD has said to David, ‘Through My servant David I will save My people Israel from the hands of the Philistines and of all their enemies.’” 
10003019	Abner also spoke to the Benjamites. Then he went to Hebron to tell David all that seemed good to Israel and to the whole house of Benjamin. 
10003020	When Abner and twenty of his men came to David at Hebron, David held a feast for them. 
10003021	Then Abner said to David, “Let me go at once, and I will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may rule over all that your heart desires.” So David dismissed Abner, and he went in peace. 
10003022	Just then David’s soldiers and Joab returned from a raid, bringing with them a great plunder. But Abner was not with David in Hebron, because David had sent him on his way in peace. 
10003023	When Joab and all his troops arrived, he was informed, “Abner son of Ner came to see the king, who sent him on his way in peace.” 
10003024	So Joab went to the king and said, “What have you done? Look, Abner came to you. Why did you dismiss him? Now he is getting away! 
10003025	Surely you realize that Abner son of Ner came to deceive you and to track your movements and all that you are doing.” 
10003026	As soon as Joab had left David, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him back from the well of Sirah. But David was unaware of it. 
10003027	When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab pulled him aside into the gateway, as if to speak to him privately, and there Joab stabbed him in the stomach. So Abner died on account of the blood of Joab’s brother Asahel. 
10003028	Afterward, David heard about this and said, “I and my kingdom are forever guiltless before the LORD concerning the blood of Abner son of Ner. 
10003029	May it whirl over the head of Joab and over the entire house of his father, and may the house of Joab never be without one having a discharge or skin disease, or one who leans on a staff or falls by the sword or lacks food.” 
10003030	(Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.) 
10003031	Then David ordered Joab and all the people with him, “Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourn before Abner.” And King David himself walked behind the funeral bier. 
10003032	When they buried Abner in Hebron, the king wept aloud at Abner’s tomb, and all the people wept. 
10003033	And the king sang this lament for Abner: “Should Abner die the death of a fool? 
10003034	Your hands were not bound, your feet were not fettered. As a man falls before the wicked, so also you fell.” And all the people wept over him even more. 
10003035	Then all the people came and urged David to eat something while it was still day, but David took an oath, saying, “May God punish me, and ever so severely, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets!” 
10003036	All the people took note and were pleased. In fact, everything the king did pleased them. 
10003037	So on that day all the troops and all Israel were convinced that the king had no part in the murder of Abner son of Ner. 
10003038	Then the king said to his servants, “Do you not realize that a great prince has fallen today in Israel? 
10003039	And I am weak this day, though anointed as king, and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too fierce for me. May the LORD repay the evildoer according to his evil!” 
10004001	Now when Ish-bosheth son of Saul heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost courage, and all Israel was dismayed. 
10004002	Saul’s son had two men who were leaders of raiding parties. One was named Baanah and the other Rechab; they were sons of Rimmon the Beerothite of the tribe of Benjamin—Beeroth is considered part of Benjamin, 
10004003	because the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have lived there as foreigners to this day. 
10004004	And Jonathan son of Saul had a son who was lame in his feet. He was five years old when the report about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled, but as she was hurrying to escape, he fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth. 
10004005	Now Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, set out and arrived at the house of Ish-bosheth in the heat of the day, while the king was taking his midday nap. 
10004006	They entered the interior of the house as if to get some wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rechab and his brother Baanah slipped away. 
10004007	They had entered the house while Ish-bosheth was lying on his bed, and having stabbed and killed him, they beheaded him, took his head, and traveled all night by way of the Arabah. 
10004008	They brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king, “Here is the head of Ish-bosheth son of Saul, your enemy who sought your life. Today the LORD has granted vengeance to my lord the king against Saul and his offspring.” 
10004009	But David answered Rechab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, “As surely as the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life from all distress, 
10004010	when someone told me, ‘Look, Saul is dead,’ and thought he was a bearer of good news, I seized him and put him to death at Ziklag. That was his reward for his news! 
10004011	How much more, when wicked men kill a righteous man in his own house and on his own bed, shall I not now require his blood from your hands and remove you from the earth!” 
10004012	So David commanded his young men, and they killed Rechab and Baanah. They cut off their hands and feet and hung their bodies by the pool in Hebron, but they took the head of Ish-bosheth and buried it in Abner’s tomb in Hebron. 
10005001	Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, “Here we are, your own flesh and blood. 
10005002	Even in times past, while Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel out and brought them back. And to you the LORD said, ‘You will shepherd My people Israel, and you will be ruler over them.’” 
10005003	So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, where King David made with them a covenant before the LORD. And they anointed him king over Israel. 
10005004	David was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years. 
10005005	In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah. 
10005006	Now the king and his men marched to Jerusalem against the Jebusites who inhabited the land. The Jebusites said to David: “You will never get in here. Even the blind and lame can repel you.” For they thought, “David cannot get in here.” 
10005007	Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion (that is, the City of David). 
10005008	On that day he said, “Whoever attacks the Jebusites must use the water shaft to reach the lame and blind who are despised by David.” That is why it is said, “The blind and the lame will never enter the palace.” 
10005009	So David took up residence in the fortress and called it the City of David. He built it up all the way around, from the supporting terraces inward. 
10005010	And David became greater and greater, for the LORD God of Hosts was with him. 
10005011	Now Hiram king of Tyre sent envoys to David, along with cedar logs, carpenters, and stonemasons, and they built a palace for David. 
10005012	And David realized that the LORD had established him as king over Israel and had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel. 
10005013	After he had arrived from Hebron, David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, and more sons and daughters were born to him. 
10005014	These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
10005015	Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 
10005016	Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet. 
10005017	When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, they all went in search of him; but David learned of this and went down to the stronghold. 
10005018	Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. 
10005019	So David inquired of the LORD, “Should I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand?” “Go up,” replied the LORD, “for I will surely deliver the Philistines into your hand.” 
10005020	So David went to Baal-perazim, where he defeated the Philistines and said, “Like a bursting flood, the LORD has burst out against my enemies before me.” So he called that place Baal-perazim. 
10005021	There the Philistines abandoned their idols, and David and his men carried them away. 
10005022	Once again the Philistines came up and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. 
10005023	So David inquired of the LORD, who answered, “Do not march straight up, but circle around behind them and attack them in front of the balsam trees. 
10005024	As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, move quickly, because this will mean that the LORD has gone out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.” 
10005025	So David did as the LORD had commanded him, and he struck down the Philistines all the way from Gibeon to Gezer. 
10006001	David again assembled the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand in all. 
10006002	And he and all his troops set out for Baale of Judah to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name— the name of the LORD of Hosts, who is enthroned between the cherubim that are on it. 
10006003	They set the ark of God on a new cart and brought it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were guiding the new cart, 
10006004	bringing with it the ark of God. And Ahio was walking in front of the ark. 
10006005	David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before the LORD with all kinds of wood instruments, harps, stringed instruments, tambourines, sistrums, and cymbals. 
10006006	When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark of God, because the oxen had stumbled. 
10006007	And the anger of the LORD burned against Uzzah, and God struck him down on the spot for his irreverence, and he died there beside the ark of God. 
10006008	Then David became angry because the LORD had burst forth against Uzzah. So he named that place Perez-uzzah, as it is called to this day. 
10006009	That day David feared the LORD and asked, “How can the ark of the LORD ever come to me?” 
10006010	So he was unwilling to move the ark of the LORD to the City of David; instead, he took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. 
10006011	Thus the ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for three months, and the LORD blessed him and all his household. 
10006012	Now it was reported to King David, “The LORD has blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God.” So David went and had the ark of God brought up from the house of Obed-edom into the City of David with rejoicing. 
10006013	When those carrying the ark of the LORD had advanced six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf. 
10006014	And David, wearing a linen ephod, danced with all his might before the LORD, 
10006015	while he and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting and the sounding of the ram’s horn. 
10006016	As the ark of the LORD was entering the City of David, Saul’s daughter Michal looked down from a window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD, and she despised him in her heart. 
10006017	So they brought the ark of the LORD and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it. Then David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. 
10006018	When David had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of Hosts. 
10006019	Then he distributed to every man and woman among the multitude of Israel a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake. And all the people departed, each to his own home. 
10006020	When David returned home to bless his own household, Saul’s daughter Michal came out to meet him. “How the king of Israel has distinguished himself today!” she said. “He has uncovered himself today in the sight of the maidservants of his subjects, like a vulgar person would do.” 
10006021	But David said to Michal, “I was dancing before the LORD, who chose me over your father and all his house when He appointed me ruler over the LORD’s people Israel. I will celebrate before the LORD, 
10006022	and I will humiliate and humble myself even more than this. Yet I will be honored by the maidservants of whom you have spoken.” 
10006023	And Michal the daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death. 
10007001	After the king had settled into his palace and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies around him, 
10007002	he said to Nathan the prophet, “Here I am, living in a house of cedar, while the ark of God remains in a tent.” 
10007003	And Nathan replied to the king, “Go and do all that is in your heart, for the LORD is with you.” 
10007004	But that night the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying, 
10007005	“Go and tell My servant David that this is what the LORD says: Are you the one to build for Me a house to dwell in? 
10007006	For I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought the Israelites up out of Egypt until this day, but I have moved about with a tent as My dwelling. 
10007007	In all My journeys with all the Israelites, have I ever asked any of the leaders I appointed to shepherd My people Israel, ‘Why haven’t you built Me a house of cedar?’ 
10007008	Now then, you are to tell My servant David that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: I took you from the pasture, from following the flock, to be the ruler over My people Israel. 
10007009	I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make for you a name like that of the greatest in the land. 
10007010	And I will provide a place for My people Israel and will plant them so that they may dwell in a place of their own and be disturbed no more. No longer will the sons of wickedness oppress them as they did at the beginning 
10007011	and have done since the day I appointed judges over My people Israel. I will give you rest from all your enemies. The LORD declares to you that He Himself will establish a house for you. 
10007012	And when your days are fulfilled and you rest with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant after you, who will come from your own body, and I will establish his kingdom. 
10007013	He will build a house for My Name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. 
10007014	I will be his Father, and he will be My son. When he does wrong, I will discipline him with the rod of men and with the blows of the sons of men. 
10007015	But My loving devotion will never be removed from him as I removed it from Saul, whom I removed from before you. 
10007016	Your house and kingdom will endure forever before Me, and your throne will be established forever.” 
10007017	So Nathan relayed to David all the words of this entire revelation. 
10007018	Then King David went in, sat before the LORD, and said, “Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that You have brought me this far? 
10007019	And as if this was a small thing in Your eyes, O Lord GOD, You have also spoken about the future of the house of Your servant. Is this Your custom with man, O Lord GOD? 
10007020	What more can David say to You? For You know Your servant, O Lord GOD. 
10007021	For the sake of Your word and according to Your own heart, You have accomplished this great thing and revealed it to Your servant. 
10007022	How great You are, O Lord GOD! For there is none like You, and there is no God but You, according to everything we have heard with our own ears. 
10007023	And who is like Your people Israel—the one nation on earth whom God went out to redeem as a people for Himself and to make a name for Himself? You performed great and awesome wonders by driving out nations and their gods from before Your people, whom You redeemed for Yourself from Egypt. 
10007024	For You have established Your people Israel as Your very own forever, and You, O LORD, have become their God. 
10007025	And now, O LORD God, confirm forever the word You have spoken concerning Your servant and his house. Do as You have promised, 
10007026	so that Your name will be magnified forever when it is said, ‘The LORD of Hosts is God over Israel.’ And the house of Your servant David will be established before You. 
10007027	For You, O LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, have revealed this to Your servant when You said, ‘I will build a house for you.’ Therefore Your servant has found the courage to offer this prayer to You. 
10007028	And now, O Lord GOD, You are God! Your words are true, and You have promised this goodness to Your servant. 
10007029	Now therefore, may it please You to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue forever before You. For You, O Lord GOD, have spoken, and with Your blessing the house of Your servant will be blessed forever.” 
10008001	Some time later, David defeated the Philistines, subdued them, and took Metheg-ammah from the hand of the Philistines. 
10008002	David also defeated the Moabites, made them lie down on the ground, and measured them off with a cord. He measured off with two lengths those to be put to death, and with one length those to be spared. So the Moabites became subject to David and brought him tribute. 
10008003	David also defeated Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah, who had marched out to restore his dominion along the Euphrates River. 
10008004	David captured from him a thousand chariots, seven thousand charioteers, and twenty thousand foot soldiers, and he hamstrung all the horses except a hundred he kept for the chariots. 
10008005	When the Arameans of Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, David struck down twenty-two thousand of their men. 
10008006	Then he placed garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans became subject to David and brought him tribute. So the LORD made David victorious wherever he went. 
10008007	And David took the gold shields that belonged to the officers of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem. 
10008008	And from Betah and Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took a large amount of bronze. 
10008009	When King Toi of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer, 
10008010	he sent his son Joram to greet King David and bless him for fighting and defeating Hadadezer, who had been at war with Toi. Joram brought with him articles of silver and gold and bronze, 
10008011	and King David dedicated these to the LORD, along with the silver and gold he had dedicated from all the nations he had subdued— 
10008012	from Edom and Moab, from the Ammonites and Philistines and Amalekites, and from the spoil of Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah. 
10008013	And David made a name for himself when he returned from striking down eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 
10008014	He placed garrisons throughout Edom, and all the Edomites were subject to David. So the LORD made David victorious wherever he went. 
10008015	Thus David reigned over all Israel and administered justice and righteousness for all his people: 
10008016	Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder; 
10008017	Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests; Seraiah was the scribe; 
10008018	Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and Pelethites; and David’s sons were priestly leaders. 
10009001	Then David asked, “Is there anyone left from the house of Saul to whom I can show kindness for the sake of Jonathan?” 
10009002	And there was a servant of the house of Saul named Ziba. They summoned him to David, and the king inquired, “Are you Ziba?” “I am your servant,” he replied. 
10009003	So the king asked, “Is there anyone left of the house of Saul to whom I can show the kindness of God?” Ziba answered, “There is still Jonathan’s son, who is lame in both feet.” 
10009004	“Where is he?” replied the king. And Ziba said, “Indeed, he is in Lo-debar at the house of Machir son of Ammiel.” 
10009005	So King David had him brought from the house of Machir son of Ammiel in Lo-debar. 
10009006	And when Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, he fell facedown in reverence. Then David said, “Mephibosheth!” “I am your servant,” he replied. 
10009007	“Do not be afraid,” said David, “for surely I will show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will restore to you all the land of your grandfather Saul, and you will always eat at my table.” 
10009008	Mephibosheth bowed down and said, “What is your servant, that you should show regard for a dead dog like me?” 
10009009	Then the king summoned Saul’s servant Ziba and said to him, “I have given to your master’s grandson all that belonged to Saul and to all his house. 
10009010	You and your sons and servants are to work the ground for him and bring in the harvest, so that your master’s grandson may have food to eat. But Mephibosheth, your master’s grandson, is always to eat at my table.” Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. 
10009011	And Ziba said to the king, “Your servant will do all that my lord the king has commanded.” So Mephibosheth ate at David’s table like one of the king’s own sons. 
10009012	And Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica, and all who dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants of Mephibosheth. 
10009013	So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, because he always ate at the king’s table, and he was lame in both feet. 
10010001	Some time later, the king of the Ammonites died and was succeeded by his son Hanun. 
10010002	And David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent some of his servants to console Hanun concerning his father. But when they arrived in the land of the Ammonites, 
10010003	the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun their lord, “Just because David has sent you comforters, do you really believe he is showing respect for your father? Has not David instead sent his servants to explore the city, spy it out, and overthrow it?” 
10010004	So Hanun took David’s servants, shaved off half of each man’s beard, cut off their garments at the hips, and sent them away. 
10010005	When this was reported to David, he sent messengers to meet the men, since they had been thoroughly humiliated. The king told them, “Stay in Jericho until your beards have grown back, and then return.” 
10010006	When the Ammonites realized that they had become a stench to David, they hired twenty thousand Aramean foot soldiers from Beth-rehob and Zoba, as well as a thousand men from the king of Maacah and twelve thousand men from Tob. 
10010007	On hearing this, David sent Joab and the entire army of mighty men. 
10010008	The Ammonites marched out and arrayed themselves for battle at the entrance of the city gate, while the Arameans of Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the open country. 
10010009	When Joab saw the battle lines before him and behind him, he selected some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the Arameans. 
10010010	And he placed the rest of the troops under the command of his brother Abishai, who arrayed them against the Ammonites. 
10010011	“If the Arameans are too strong for me,” said Joab, “then you will come to my rescue. And if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come to your rescue. 
10010012	Be strong and let us fight bravely for our people and for the cities of our God. May the LORD do what is good in His sight.” 
10010013	So Joab and his troops advanced to fight the Arameans, who fled before him. 
10010014	When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had fled, they too fled before Abishai, and they entered the city. So Joab returned from fighting against the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem. 
10010015	When the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they regrouped. 
10010016	Hadadezer sent messengers to bring more Arameans from beyond the Euphrates, and they came to Helam with Shobach the commander of Hadadezer’s army leading them. 
10010017	When this was reported to David, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan, and went to Helam. Then the Arameans arrayed themselves against David and fought against him. 
10010018	But the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed seven hundred charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers. He also struck down Shobach the commander of their army, who died there. 
10010019	When all the kings who were subject to Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and became subject to them. So the Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites anymore. 
10011001	In the spring, at the time when kings march out to war, David sent out Joab and his servants with the whole army of Israel. They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah, but David remained in Jerusalem. 
10011002	One evening David got up from his bed and strolled around on the roof of the palace. And from the roof he saw a woman bathing—a very beautiful woman. 
10011003	So David sent and inquired about the woman, and he was told, “This is Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite.” 
10011004	Then David sent messengers to get her, and when she came to him, he slept with her. (Now she had just purified herself from her uncleanness.) Then she returned home. 
10011005	And the woman conceived and sent word to David, saying, “I am pregnant.” 
10011006	At this, David sent orders to Joab: “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” So Joab sent him to David. 
10011007	When Uriah came to him, David asked how Joab and the troops were doing and how the war was going. 
10011008	Then he said to Uriah, “Go down to your house and wash your feet.” So Uriah left the palace, and a gift from the king followed him. 
10011009	But Uriah slept at the door of the palace with all his master’s servants; he did not go down to his house. 
10011010	And David was told, “Uriah did not go home.” “Haven’t you just arrived from a journey?” David asked Uriah. “Why didn’t you go home?” 
10011011	Uriah answered, “The ark and Israel and Judah are dwelling in tents, and my master Joab and his soldiers are camped in the open field. How can I go to my house to eat and drink and sleep with my wife? As surely as you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do such a thing!” 
10011012	“Stay here one more day,” David said to Uriah, “and tomorrow I will send you back.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next. 
10011013	Then David invited Uriah to eat and drink with him, and he got Uriah drunk. And in the evening Uriah went out to lie down on his cot with his master’s servants, but he did not go home. 
10011014	The next morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah. 
10011015	In the letter he wrote: “Put Uriah at the front of the fiercest battle; then withdraw from him, so that he may be struck down and killed.” 
10011016	So as Joab besieged the city, he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew the strongest enemy soldiers were. 
10011017	And when the men of the city came out and fought against Joab, some of David’s servants fell, and Uriah the Hittite also died. 
10011018	Joab sent to David a full account of the battle 
10011019	and instructed the messenger, “When you have finished giving the king a full account of the battle, 
10011020	if the king’s anger flares, he may ask you, ‘Why did you get so close to the city to fight? Did you not realize they would shoot from atop the wall? 
10011021	Who struck Abimelech son of Jerubbesheth ? Was it not a woman who dropped an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez? Why did you get so close to the wall?’ If he asks you this, then you are to say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead as well.’” 
10011022	So the messenger set out and reported to David all that Joab had sent him to say. 
10011023	The messenger said to David, “The men overpowered us and came out against us in the field, but we drove them back to the entrance of the gate. 
10011024	Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall, and some of the king’s servants were killed. And your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead as well.” 
10011025	Then David told the messenger, “Say this to Joab: ‘Do not let this matter upset you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Strengthen your attack against the city and demolish it.’ Encourage him with these words.” 
10011026	When Uriah’s wife heard that her husband was dead, she mourned for him. 
10011027	And when the time of mourning was over, David had her brought to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done was evil in the sight of the LORD. 
10012001	Then the LORD sent Nathan to David, and when he arrived, he said, “There were two men in a certain city, one rich and the other poor. 
10012002	The rich man had a great number of sheep and cattle, 
10012003	but the poor man had nothing except one small ewe lamb that he had bought. He raised it, and it grew up with him and his children. It shared his food and drank from his cup; it slept in his arms and was like a daughter to him. 
10012004	Now a traveler came to the rich man, who refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the poor man’s lamb and prepared it for his guest.” 
10012005	David burned with anger against the man and said to Nathan: “As surely as the LORD lives, the man who did this deserves to die! 
10012006	Because he has done this thing and has shown no pity, he must pay for the lamb four times over.” 
10012007	Then Nathan said to David, “You are that man! This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul. 
10012008	I gave your master’s house to you and your master’s wives into your arms. I gave you the house of Israel and Judah, and if that was not enough, I would have given you even more. 
10012009	Why then have you despised the command of the LORD by doing evil in His sight? You put Uriah the Hittite to the sword and took his wife as your own. You have slain him with the sword of the Ammonites. 
10012010	Now, therefore, the sword will never depart from your house, because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.’ 
10012011	This is what the LORD says: ‘I will raise up adversity against you from your own house. Before your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to another, and he will lie with them in broad daylight. 
10012012	You have acted in secret, but I will do this thing in broad daylight before all Israel.’” 
10012013	Then David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the LORD.” “The LORD has taken away your sin,” Nathan replied. “You will not die. 
10012014	Nevertheless, because by this deed you have shown utter contempt for the word of the LORD, the son born to you will surely die.” 
10012015	After Nathan had gone home, the LORD struck the child that Uriah’s wife had borne to David, and he became ill. 
10012016	David pleaded with God for the boy. He fasted and went into his house and spent the night lying in sackcloth on the ground. 
10012017	The elders of his household stood beside him to help him up from the ground, but he was unwilling and would not eat anything with them. 
10012018	On the seventh day the child died. But David’s servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, “Look, while the child was alive, we spoke to him, and he would not listen to us. So how can we tell him the child is dead? He may even harm himself.” 
10012019	When David saw that his servants were whispering to one another, he perceived that the child was dead. So he asked his servants, “Is the child dead?” “He is dead,” they replied. 
10012020	Then David got up from the ground, washed and anointed himself, changed his clothes, and went into the house of the LORD and worshiped. Then he went to his own house, and at his request they set food before him, and he ate. 
10012021	“What is this you have done?” his servants asked. “While the child was alive, you fasted and wept, but when he died, you got up and ate.” 
10012022	David answered, “While the child was alive, I fasted and wept, for I said, ‘Who knows? The LORD may be gracious to me and let him live.’ 
10012023	But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.” 
10012024	Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and he went to her and lay with her. So she gave birth to a son, and they named him Solomon. Now the LORD loved the child 
10012025	and sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah because the LORD loved him. 
10012026	Meanwhile, Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and captured the royal fortress. 
10012027	Then Joab sent messengers to David to say, “I have fought against Rabbah and have captured the water supply of the city. 
10012028	Now, therefore, assemble the rest of the troops, lay siege to the city, and capture it. Otherwise I will capture the city, and it will be named after me.” 
10012029	So David assembled all the troops and went to Rabbah; and he fought against it and captured it. 
10012030	Then he took the crown from the head of their king. It weighed a talent of gold and was set with precious stones, and it was placed on David’s head. And David took a great amount of plunder from the city. 
10012031	David brought out the people who were there and put them to work with saws, iron picks, and axes, and he made them work at the brick kilns. He did the same to all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all his troops returned to Jerusalem. 
10013001	After some time, David’s son Amnon fell in love with Tamar, the beautiful sister of David’s son Absalom. 
10013002	Amnon was sick with frustration over his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin, and it seemed implausible for him to do anything to her. 
10013003	Now Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, the son of David’s brother Shimeah. Jonadab was a very shrewd man, 
10013004	and he asked Amnon, “Why are you, the son of the king, so depressed morning after morning? Won’t you tell me?” Amnon replied, “I am in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.” 
10013005	Jonadab told him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend you are ill. When your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me something to eat. Let her prepare it in my sight so I may watch her and eat it from her hand.’” 
10013006	So Amnon lay down and feigned illness. When the king came to see him, Amnon said, “Please let my sister Tamar come and make a couple of cakes in my sight, so that I may eat from her hand.” 
10013007	Then David sent word to Tamar at the palace: “Please go to the house of Amnon your brother and prepare a meal for him.” 
10013008	So Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon, who was lying down. She took some dough, kneaded it, made cakes in his sight, and baked them. 
10013009	Then she brought the pan and set it down before him, but he refused to eat. “Send everyone away!” said Amnon. And everyone went out. 
10013010	Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the bedroom, so that I may eat it from your hand.” Tamar took the cakes she had made and went to her brother Amnon’s bedroom. 
10013011	And when she had brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her and said, “Come lie with me, my sister!” 
10013012	“No, my brother!” she cried. “Do not violate me, for such a thing should never be done in Israel. Do not do this disgraceful thing! 
10013013	Where could I ever take my shame? And you would be like one of the fools in Israel! Please speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you.” 
10013014	But Amnon refused to listen to her, and being stronger, he violated her and lay with her. 
10013015	Then Amnon hated Tamar with such intensity that his hatred was greater than the love he previously had. “Get up!” he said to her. “Be gone!” 
10013016	“No,” she replied, “sending me away is worse than this great wrong you have already done to me!” But he refused to listen to her. 
10013017	Instead, he called to his attendant and said, “Throw this woman out and bolt the door behind her!” 
10013018	So Amnon’s attendant threw her out and bolted the door behind her. Now Tamar was wearing a robe of many colors, because this is what the king’s virgin daughters wore. 
10013019	And Tamar put ashes on her head and tore her robe. And putting her hand on her head, she went away crying aloud. 
10013020	Her brother Absalom said to her, “Has your brother Amnon been with you? Be quiet for now, my sister. He is your brother. Do not take this thing to heart.” So Tamar lived as a desolate woman in the house of her brother Absalom. 
10013021	When King David heard all this, he was furious. 
10013022	And Absalom never said a word to Amnon, either good or bad, because he hated Amnon for violating his sister Tamar. 
10013023	Two years later, when Absalom’s sheepshearers were at Baal-hazor near Ephraim, he invited all the sons of the king. 
10013024	And he went to the king and said, “Your servant has just hired shearers. Will the king and his servants please come with me?” 
10013025	“No, my son,” the king replied, “we should not all go, or we would be a burden to you.” Although Absalom urged him, he was not willing to go, but gave him his blessing. 
10013026	“If not,” said Absalom, “please let my brother Amnon go with us.” “Why should he go with you?” the king asked. 
10013027	But Absalom urged him, so the king sent Amnon and the rest of his sons. 
10013028	Now Absalom had ordered his young men, “Watch Amnon until his heart is merry with wine, and when I order you to strike Amnon down, you are to kill him. Do not be afraid. Have I not commanded you? Be courageous and valiant!” 
10013029	So Absalom’s young men did to Amnon just as Absalom had ordered. Then all the other sons of the king got up, and each one fled on his mule. 
10013030	While they were on the way, a report reached David: “Absalom has struck down all the sons of the king; not one of them is left!” 
10013031	Then the king stood up, tore his clothes, and lay down on the ground. And all his servants stood by with their clothes torn. 
10013032	But Jonadab, the son of David’s brother Shimeah, spoke up: “My lord must not think they have killed all the sons of the king, for only Amnon is dead. In fact, Absalom has planned this since the day Amnon violated his sister Tamar. 
10013033	So now, my lord the king, do not take to heart the report that all the sons of the king are dead. Only Amnon is dead.” 
10013034	Meanwhile, Absalom had fled. When the young man standing watch looked up, he saw many people coming down the road west of him, along the side of the hill. And the watchman went and reported to the king, “I see men coming from the direction of Horonaim, along the side of the hill.” 
10013035	So Jonadab said to the king, “Look, the sons of the king have arrived! It is just as your servant said.” 
10013036	And as he finished speaking, the sons of the king came in, wailing loudly. Then the king and all his servants also wept very bitterly. 
10013037	Now Absalom fled and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. But David mourned for his son every day. 
10013038	After Absalom had fled and gone to Geshur, he stayed there three years. 
10013039	And King David longed to go to Absalom, for he had been consoled over Amnon’s death. 
10014001	Now Joab son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart longed for Absalom. 
10014002	So Joab sent to Tekoa to bring a wise woman from there. He told her, “Please pretend to be a mourner; put on clothes for mourning and do not anoint yourself with oil. Act like a woman who has mourned for the dead a long time. 
10014003	Then go to the king and speak these words to him.” And Joab put the words in her mouth. 
10014004	When the woman from Tekoa went to the king, she fell facedown in homage and said, “Help me, O king!” 
10014005	“What troubles you?” the king asked her. “Indeed,” she said, “I am a widow, for my husband is dead. 
10014006	And your maidservant had two sons who were fighting in the field with no one to separate them, and one struck the other and killed him. 
10014007	Now the whole clan has risen up against your maidservant and said, ‘Hand over the one who struck down his brother, that we may put him to death for the life of the brother whom he killed. Then we will cut off the heir as well!’ So they would extinguish my one remaining ember by not preserving my husband’s name or posterity on the earth.” 
10014008	“Go home,” the king said to the woman, “and I will give orders on your behalf.” 
10014009	But the woman of Tekoa said to the king, “My lord the king, may any blame be on me and on my father’s house, and may the king and his throne be guiltless.” 
10014010	“If anyone speaks to you,” said the king, “bring him to me, and he will not trouble you again!” 
10014011	“Please,” she replied, “may the king invoke the LORD your God to prevent the avenger of blood from increasing the devastation, so that my son may not be destroyed!” “As surely as the LORD lives,” he vowed, “not a hair of your son’s head will fall to the ground.” 
10014012	Then the woman said, “Please, may your servant speak a word to my lord the king?” “Speak,” he replied. 
10014013	The woman asked, “Why have you devised a thing like this against the people of God? When the king says this, does he not convict himself, since he has not brought back his own banished son? 
10014014	For we will surely die and be like water poured out on the ground, which cannot be recovered. Yet God does not take away a life, but He devises ways that the banished one may not be cast out from Him. 
10014015	Now therefore, I have come to present this matter to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. Your servant thought, ‘I will speak to the king. Perhaps he will grant the request of his maidservant. 
10014016	For the king will hear and deliver his maidservant from the hand of the man who would cut off both me and my son from God’s inheritance.’ 
10014017	And now your servant says, ‘May the word of my lord the king bring me rest, for my lord the king is able to discern good and evil, just like the angel of God. May the LORD your God be with you.’” 
10014018	Then the king said to the woman, “I am going to ask you something; do not conceal it from me!” “Let my lord the king speak,” she replied. 
10014019	So the king asked, “Is the hand of Joab behind all this?” The woman answered, “As surely as you live, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything that my lord the king says. Yes, your servant Joab is the one who gave me orders; he told your maidservant exactly what to say. 
10014020	Joab your servant has done this to bring about this change of affairs, but my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God, to know everything that happens in the land.” 
10014021	Then the king said to Joab, “I hereby grant this request. Go, bring back the young man Absalom.” 
10014022	Joab fell facedown in homage and blessed the king. “Today,” said Joab, “your servant knows that he has found favor in your eyes, my lord the king, because the king has granted his request.” 
10014023	So Joab got up, went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. 
10014024	But the king added, “He may return to his house, but he must not see my face.” So Absalom returned to his own house, but he did not see the face of the king. 
10014025	Now there was not a man in all Israel as handsome and highly praised as Absalom. From the sole of his foot to the top of his head, he did not have a single flaw. 
10014026	And when he cut the hair of his head—he shaved it every year because his hair got so heavy—he would weigh it out to be two hundred shekels, according to the royal standard. 
10014027	Three sons were born to Absalom, and a daughter named Tamar, who was a beautiful woman. 
10014028	Now Absalom lived in Jerusalem two years without seeing the face of the king. 
10014029	Then he sent for Joab to send him to the king, but Joab refused to come to him. So Absalom sent a second time, but Joab still would not come. 
10014030	Then Absalom said to his servants, “Look, Joab’s field is next to mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire!” And Absalom’s servants set the field on fire. 
10014031	Then Joab came to Absalom’s house and demanded, “Why did your servants set my field on fire?” 
10014032	“Look,” said Absalom, “I sent for you and said, ‘Come here. I want to send you to the king to ask: Why have I come back from Geshur? It would be better for me if I were still there.’ So now, let me see the king’s face, and if there is iniquity in me, let him kill me.” 
10014033	So Joab went and told the king, and David summoned Absalom, who came to him and bowed facedown before him. Then the king kissed Absalom. 
10015001	Some time later, Absalom provided for himself a chariot with horses and fifty men to run ahead of him. 
10015002	He would get up early and stand beside the road leading to the city gate. Whenever anyone had a grievance to bring before the king for a decision, Absalom would call out and ask, “What city are you from?” And if he replied, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel,” 
10015003	Absalom would say, “Look, your claims are good and right, but the king has no deputy to hear you.” 
10015004	And he would add, “If only someone would appoint me judge in the land, then everyone with a grievance or dispute could come to me, and I would give him justice.” 
10015005	Also, when anyone approached to bow down to him, Absalom would reach out his hand, take hold of him, and kiss him. 
10015006	Absalom did this to all the Israelites who came to the king for justice. In this way he stole the hearts of the men of Israel. 
10015007	After four years had passed, Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go to Hebron to fulfill a vow I have made to the LORD. 
10015008	For your servant made a vow while dwelling in Geshur of Aram, saying: ‘If indeed the LORD brings me back to Jerusalem, I will worship the LORD in Hebron.’” 
10015009	“Go in peace,” said the king. So Absalom got up and went to Hebron. 
10015010	Then Absalom sent spies throughout the tribes of Israel with this message: “When you hear the sound of the horn, you are to say, ‘Absalom reigns in Hebron!’” 
10015011	Two hundred men from Jerusalem accompanied Absalom. They had been invited as guests and they went along innocently, for they knew nothing about the matter. 
10015012	While Absalom was offering the sacrifices, he sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, to come from his hometown of Giloh. So the conspiracy gained strength, and Absalom’s following kept increasing. 
10015013	Then a messenger came to David and reported, “The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom.” 
10015014	And David said to all the servants with him in Jerusalem, “Arise and let us flee, or we will not escape from Absalom! We must leave quickly, or he will soon overtake us, heap disaster on us, and put the city to the sword.” 
10015015	The king’s servants replied, “Whatever our lord the king decides, we are your servants.” 
10015016	Then the king set out, and his entire household followed him. But he left behind ten concubines to take care of the palace. 
10015017	So the king set out with all the people following him. He stopped at the last house, 
10015018	and all his servants marched past him—all the Cherethites and Pelethites, and six hundred Gittites who had followed him from Gath. 
10015019	Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why should you also go with us? Go back and stay with the new king, since you are both a foreigner and an exile from your homeland. 
10015020	In fact, you arrived only yesterday; should I make you wander around with us today while I do not know where I am going? Go back and take your brothers with you. May the LORD show you loving devotion and faithfulness.” 
10015021	But Ittai answered the king, “As surely as the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether it means life or death, there will your servant be!” 
10015022	“March on then,” said David to Ittai. So Ittai the Gittite marched past with all his men and all the little ones who were with him. 
10015023	Everyone in the countryside was weeping loudly as all the people passed by. And as the king crossed the Kidron Valley, all the people also passed toward the way of the wilderness. 
10015024	Zadok was also there, and all the Levites with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God, and Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people had passed out of the city. 
10015025	Then the king said to Zadok, “Return the ark of God to the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the LORD, He will bring me back and let me see both it and His dwelling place again. 
10015026	But if He should say, ‘I do not delight in you,’ then here I am; let Him do to me whatever seems good to Him.” 
10015027	The king also said to Zadok the priest, “Are you not a seer? Return to the city in peace—you with your son Ahimaaz, and Abiathar with his son Jonathan. 
10015028	See, I will wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.” 
10015029	So Zadok and Abiathar returned the ark of God to Jerusalem and stayed there. 
10015030	But David continued up the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went up. His head was covered, and he was walking barefoot. And all the people with him covered their heads and went up, weeping as they went. 
10015031	Now someone told David: “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.” So David pleaded, “O LORD, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness!” 
10015032	When David came to the summit, where he used to worship God, Hushai the Archite was there to meet him with his robe torn and dust on his head. 
10015033	David said to him, “If you go on with me, you will be a burden to me. 
10015034	But you can thwart the counsel of Ahithophel for me if you return to the city and say to Absalom: ‘I will be your servant, my king; in the past I was your father’s servant, but now I will be your servant.’ 
10015035	Will not Zadok and Abiathar the priests be there with you? Report to them everything you hear from the king’s palace. 
10015036	Indeed, their two sons, Ahimaaz son of Zadok and Jonathan son of Abiathar, are there with them. Send them to me with everything you hear.” 
10015037	So David’s friend Hushai arrived in Jerusalem just as Absalom was entering the city. 
10016001	When David had gone a little beyond the summit, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth was there to meet him. He had a pair of saddled donkeys loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred clusters of raisins, a hundred summer fruits, and a skin of wine. 
10016002	“Why do you have these?” asked the king. Ziba replied, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride, the bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat, and the wine is to refresh those who become exhausted in the wilderness.” 
10016003	“Where is your master’s grandson?” asked the king. And Ziba answered, “Indeed, he is staying in Jerusalem, for he has said, ‘Today, the house of Israel will restore to me the kingdom of my grandfather.’” 
10016004	So the king said to Ziba, “All that belongs to Mephibosheth is now yours!” “I humbly bow before you,” said Ziba. “May I find favor in your eyes, my lord the king!” 
10016005	As King David approached Bahurim, a man from the family of the house of Saul was just coming out. His name was Shimei son of Gera, and as he approached, he kept yelling out curses. 
10016006	He threw stones at David and at all the servants of the king, though the troops and all the mighty men were on David’s right and left. 
10016007	And as he yelled curses, Shimei said, “Get out, get out, you worthless man of bloodshed! 
10016008	The LORD has paid you back for all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned, and the LORD has delivered the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. See, you have come to ruin because you are a man of bloodshed!” 
10016009	Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off his head!” 
10016010	But the king replied, “What have I to do with you, O sons of Zeruiah? If he curses me because the LORD told him, ‘Curse David,’ who can ask, ‘Why did you do this?’” 
10016011	Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “Behold, my own son, my own flesh and blood, seeks my life. How much more, then, this Benjamite! Leave him alone and let him curse me, for the LORD has told him so. 
10016012	Perhaps the LORD will see my affliction and repay me with good for the cursing I receive today.” 
10016013	So David and his men proceeded along the road as Shimei went along the ridge of the hill opposite him. As Shimei went, he yelled curses, threw stones, and flung dust at David. 
10016014	Finally, the king and all the people with him arrived, exhausted. And there he refreshed himself. 
10016015	Then Absalom and all the men of Israel came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him. 
10016016	And David’s friend Hushai the Archite went to Absalom and said to him, “Long live the king! Long live the king!” 
10016017	“Is this the loyalty you show your friend?” Absalom replied. “Why did you not go with your friend?” 
10016018	“Not at all,” Hushai answered. “For the one chosen by the LORD, by this people, and by all the men of Israel—his I will be, and with him I will remain. 
10016019	Furthermore, whom should I serve if not his son? As I served in your father’s presence, so also I will serve in yours.” 
10016020	Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give me counsel. What should we do?” 
10016021	Ahithophel replied, “Sleep with your father’s concubines, whom he has left to take care of the palace. When all Israel hears that you have become a stench to your father, then the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened.” 
10016022	So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he slept with his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel. 
10016023	Now in those days the advice of Ahithophel was like the consultation of the word of God. Such was the regard that both David and Absalom had for Ahithophel’s advice. 
10017001	Furthermore, Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Let me choose twelve thousand men and set out tonight in pursuit of David. 
10017002	I will attack him while he is weak and weary; I will throw him into a panic, and all the people with him will flee; I will strike down only the king 
10017003	and bring all the people back to you as a bride returning to her husband. You seek the life of only one man; then all the people will be at peace.” 
10017004	This proposal seemed good to Absalom and all the elders of Israel. 
10017005	Then Absalom said, “Summon Hushai the Archite as well, and let us hear what he too has to say.” 
10017006	So Hushai came to Absalom, who told him, “Ahithophel has spoken this proposal. Should we carry it out? If not, what do you say?” 
10017007	Hushai replied, “This time the advice of Ahithophel is not sound.” 
10017008	He continued, “You know your father and his men. They are mighty men, and as fierce as a wild bear robbed of her cubs. Moreover, your father is a man of war who will not spend the night with the troops. 
10017009	Surely by now he is hiding in a cave or some other location. If some of your troops fall first, whoever hears of it will say, ‘There has been a slaughter among the troops who follow Absalom.’ 
10017010	Then even the most valiant soldier with the heart of a lion will melt with fear, because all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man who has valiant men with him. 
10017011	Instead, I advise that all Israel from Dan to Beersheba—a multitude like the sand on the seashore—be gathered to you, and that you yourself lead them into battle. 
10017012	Then we will attack David wherever we find him, and we will descend on him like dew on the ground. And of all the men with him, not even one will remain. 
10017013	If he retreats to a city, all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it down to the valley until not even a pebble can be found there.” 
10017014	Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The advice of Hushai the Archite is better than that of Ahithophel.” For the LORD had purposed to thwart the good counsel of Ahithophel in order to bring disaster on Absalom. 
10017015	So Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, “This is what Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the elders of Israel, and this is what I have advised. 
10017016	Now send quickly and tell David, ‘Do not spend the night at the fords of the wilderness, but be sure to cross over. Otherwise the king and all the people with him will be swallowed up.’” 
10017017	Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En-rogel, where a servant girl would come and pass along information to them. They in turn would go and inform King David, for they dared not be seen entering the city. 
10017018	But a young man did see them and told Absalom. So the two left quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim. He had a well in his courtyard, and they climbed down into it. 
10017019	Then the man’s wife took a covering, spread it over the mouth of the well, and scattered grain over it so nobody would know a thing. 
10017020	When Absalom’s servants came to the woman at the house, they asked, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” “They have crossed over the brook,” she replied. The men searched but did not find them, so they returned to Jerusalem. 
10017021	After the men had gone, Ahimaaz and Jonathan climbed up out of the well and went to inform King David, saying, “Get up and cross over the river at once, for Ahithophel has given this advice against you.” 
10017022	So David and all the people with him got up and crossed the Jordan. By daybreak, there was no one left who had not crossed the Jordan. 
10017023	When Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and set out for his house in his hometown. He put his affairs in order and hanged himself. So he died and was buried in his father’s tomb. 
10017024	Then David went to Mahanaim, and Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel. 
10017025	Absalom had appointed Amasa over the army in place of Joab. Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra, the Ishmaelite who had married Abigail, the daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah the mother of Joab. 
10017026	So the Israelites and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead. 
10017027	When David came to Mahanaim, he was met by Shobi son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, Machir son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim. 
10017028	They brought beds, basins, and earthen vessels, as well as wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils, 
10017029	honey, curds, sheep, and cheese from the herd for David and his people to eat. For they said, “The people have become hungry, exhausted, and thirsty in the wilderness.” 
10018001	Then David reviewed his troops and appointed over them commanders of thousands and of hundreds. 
10018002	He sent out the troops, a third under Joab, a third under Joab’s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and a third under Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the troops, “I will surely march out with you as well.” 
10018003	But the people pleaded, “You must not go out! For if we have to flee, they will not care about us. Even if half of us die, they will not care. But you are worth ten thousand of us. It is better now if you support us from the city.” 
10018004	“I will do whatever seems best to you,” the king replied. So he stood beside the gate, while all the troops marched out by hundreds and by thousands. 
10018005	Now the king had commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, “Treat the young man Absalom gently for my sake.” And all the people heard the king’s orders to each of the commanders regarding Absalom. 
10018006	So David’s army marched into the field to engage Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim. 
10018007	There the people of Israel were defeated by David’s servants, and the slaughter was great that day—twenty thousand men. 
10018008	The battle spread over the whole countryside, and that day the forest devoured more people than the sword. 
10018009	Now Absalom was riding on his mule when he met the servants of David, and as the mule went under the thick branches of a large oak, Absalom’s head was caught fast in the tree. The mule under him kept going, so that he was suspended in midair. 
10018010	When one of the men saw this, he told Joab, “I just saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree!” 
10018011	“You just saw him!” Joab exclaimed. “Why did you not strike him to the ground right there? I would have given you ten shekels of silver and a warrior’s belt!” 
10018012	The man replied, “Even if a thousand shekels of silver were weighed out into my hands, I would not raise my hand against the son of the king. For we heard the king command you and Abishai and Ittai, ‘Protect the young man Absalom for my sake.’ 
10018013	If I had jeopardized my own life —and nothing is hidden from the king—you would have abandoned me.” 
10018014	But Joab declared, “I am not going to wait like this with you!” And he took three spears in his hand and thrust them through the heart of Absalom while he was still alive in the oak tree. 
10018015	And ten young men who carried Joab’s armor surrounded Absalom, struck him, and killed him. 
10018016	Then Joab blew the ram’s horn, and the troops broke off their pursuit of Israel because Joab had restrained them. 
10018017	They took Absalom, cast him into a large pit in the forest, and piled a huge mound of stones over him. Meanwhile, all the Israelites fled, each to his home. 
10018018	During his lifetime, Absalom had set up for himself a pillar in the King’s Valley, for he had said, “I have no son to preserve the memory of my name.” So he gave the pillar his name, and to this day it is called Absalom’s Monument. 
10018019	Then Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, “Please let me run and tell the king the good news that the LORD has avenged him of his enemies.” 
10018020	But Joab replied, “You are not the man to take good news today. You may do it another day, but you must not do so today, because the king’s son is dead.” 
10018021	So Joab said to a Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen.” The Cushite bowed to Joab and took off running. 
10018022	Ahimaaz son of Zadok, however, persisted and said to Joab, “No matter what, please let me also run behind the Cushite!” “My son,” Joab replied, “why do you want to run, since you will not receive a reward?” 
10018023	“No matter what, I want to run!” he replied. “Then run!” Joab told him. So Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and outran the Cushite. 
10018024	Now David was sitting between the two gates when the watchman went up to the roof of the gateway by the wall, looked out, and saw a man running alone. 
10018025	So he called out and told the king. “If he is alone,” the king replied, “he bears good news.” As the first runner drew near, 
10018026	the watchman saw another man running, and he called out to the gatekeeper, “Look! Another man is running alone!” “This one also brings good news,” said the king. 
10018027	The watchman said, “The first man appears to me to be running like Ahimaaz son of Zadok.” “This is a good man,” said the king. “He comes with good news.” 
10018028	Then Ahimaaz called out to the king, “All is well!” And he bowed facedown before the king. He continued, “Blessed be the LORD your God! He has delivered up the men who raised their hands against my lord the king.” 
10018029	The king asked, “Is the young man Absalom all right?” And Ahimaaz replied, “When Joab sent the king’s servant and your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I do not know what it was.” 
10018030	“Move aside,” said the king, “and stand here.” So he stepped aside. 
10018031	Just then the Cushite came and said, “May my lord the king hear the good news: Today the LORD has avenged you of all who rose up against you!” 
10018032	The king asked the Cushite, “Is the young man Absalom all right?” And the Cushite replied, “May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up against you to harm you be like that young man.” 
10018033	The king was shaken and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept. And as he walked, he cried out, “O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!” 
10019001	Then it was reported to Joab, “The king is weeping and mourning over Absalom.” 
10019002	And that day’s victory was turned into mourning for all the people, because on that day they were told, “The king is grieving over his son.” 
10019003	So they returned to the city quietly that day, as people steal away in humiliation after fleeing a battle. 
10019004	But the king covered his face and cried out at the top of his voice, “O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!” 
10019005	Then Joab went into the house and said to the king, “Today you have disgraced all your servants who have saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters, of your wives, and of your concubines. 
10019006	You love those who hate you and hate those who love you! For you have made it clear today that the commanders and soldiers mean nothing to you. I know today that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead, it would have pleased you! 
10019007	Now therefore get up! Go out and speak comfort to your servants, for I swear by the LORD that if you do not go out, not a man will remain with you tonight. This will be worse for you than all the adversity that has befallen you from your youth until now!” 
10019008	So the king got up and sat in the gate, and all the people were told: “Behold, the king is sitting in the gate.” So they all came before the king. Meanwhile, the Israelites had fled, each man to his home. 
10019009	And all the people throughout the tribes of Israel were arguing, “The king rescued us from the hand of our enemies and delivered us from the hand of the Philistines, but now he has fled the land because of Absalom. 
10019010	But Absalom, the man we anointed over us, has died in battle. So why do you say nothing about restoring the king?” 
10019011	Then King David sent this message to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests: “Say to the elders of Judah, ‘Why should you be the last to restore the king to his palace, since the talk of all Israel has reached the king at his quarters? 
10019012	You are my brothers, my own flesh and blood. So why should you be the last to restore the king?’ 
10019013	And say to Amasa, ‘Aren’t you my flesh and blood? May God punish me, and ever so severely, if from now on you are not the commander of my army in place of Joab!’” 
10019014	So he swayed the hearts of all the men of Judah as though they were one man, and they sent word to the king: “Return, you and all your servants.” 
10019015	So the king returned, and when he arrived at the Jordan, the men of Judah came to Gilgal to meet him and escort him across the Jordan. 
10019016	Then Shimei son of Gera, a Benjamite from Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet King David, 
10019017	along with a thousand men of Benjamin, as well as Ziba the steward of the house of Saul and his fifteen sons and twenty servants. They rushed down to the Jordan before the king 
10019018	and crossed at the ford to carry over the king’s household and to do what was good in his sight. When Shimei son of Gera crossed the Jordan, he fell down before the king 
10019019	and said, “My lord, do not hold me guilty, and do not remember your servant’s wrongdoing on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. May the king not take it to heart. 
10019020	For your servant knows that I have sinned, so here I am today as the first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king.” 
10019021	But Abishai son of Zeruiah said, “Shouldn’t Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD’s anointed?” 
10019022	And David replied, “Sons of Zeruiah, what have I to do with you, that you should be my adversaries today? Should any man be put to death in Israel today? Am I not indeed aware that today I am king over Israel?” 
10019023	So the king said to Shimei, “You shall not die.” And the king swore an oath to him. 
10019024	Then Mephibosheth, Saul’s grandson, went down to meet the king. He had not cared for his feet or trimmed his mustache or washed his clothes from the day the king had left until the day he returned safely. 
10019025	And he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, who asked him, “Mephibosheth, why did you not go with me?” 
10019026	“My lord the king,” he replied, “because I am lame, I said, ‘I will have my donkey saddled so that I may ride on it and go with the king.’ But my servant Ziba deceived me, 
10019027	and he has slandered your servant to my lord the king. Yet my lord the king is like the angel of God, so do what is good in your eyes. 
10019028	For all the house of my grandfather deserves death from my lord the king, yet you have set your servant among those who eat at your table. What further right, then, do I have to keep appealing to the king?” 
10019029	The king replied, “Why say any more? I hereby declare that you and Ziba are to divide the land.” 
10019030	And Mephibosheth said to the king, “Instead, since my lord the king has safely come to his own house, let Ziba take it all!” 
10019031	Now Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim to cross the Jordan with the king and send him on his way from there. 
10019032	Barzillai was quite old, eighty years of age, and since he was a very wealthy man, he had provided for the king while he stayed in Mahanaim. 
10019033	The king said to Barzillai, “Cross over with me, and I will provide for you at my side in Jerusalem.” 
10019034	But Barzillai replied, “How many years of my life remain, that I should go up to Jerusalem with the king? 
10019035	I am now eighty years old. Can I discern what is good and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats or drinks? Can I still hear the voice of singing men and women? Why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king? 
10019036	Your servant will go with the king only a short distance past the Jordan; why should the king repay me with such a reward? 
10019037	Please let your servant return, that I may die in my own city near the tomb of my father and mother. But here is your servant Chimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him what is good in your sight.” 
10019038	The king replied, “Chimham will cross over with me, and I will do for him what is good in your sight, and I will do for you whatever you desire of me.” 
10019039	So all the people crossed the Jordan, and then the king crossed over. The king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and Barzillai returned home. 
10019040	Then the king crossed over to Gilgal, and Chimham crossed over with him. All the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel escorted the king. 
10019041	Soon all the men of Israel came to the king and asked, “Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, take you away secretly and bring the king and his household across the Jordan, together with all of David’s men?” 
10019042	And all the men of Judah replied to the men of Israel, “We did this because the king is our relative. Why does this anger you? Have we ever eaten at the king’s expense or received anything for ourselves?” 
10019043	“We have ten shares in the king,” answered the men of Israel, “so we have more claim to David than you. Why then do you despise us? Were we not the first to speak of restoring our king?” But the men of Judah spoke more fiercely than the men of Israel. 
10020001	Now a worthless man named Sheba son of Bichri, a Benjamite, happened to be there, and he blew the ram’s horn and shouted: “We have no share in David, no inheritance in Jesse’s son. Every man to his tent, O Israel!” 
10020002	So all the men of Israel deserted David to follow Sheba son of Bichri. But the men of Judah stayed by their king all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem. 
10020003	When David returned to his palace in Jerusalem, he took the ten concubines he had left to take care of the palace, and he placed them in a house under guard. He provided for them, but he no longer slept with them. They were confined until the day of their death, living as widows. 
10020004	Then the king said to Amasa, “Summon the men of Judah to come to me within three days, and be here yourself.” 
10020005	So Amasa went to summon Judah, but he took longer than the time allotted him. 
10020006	And David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom. Take your lord’s servants and pursue him, or he will find fortified cities and elude us.” 
10020007	So Joab’s men, along with the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and all the mighty men, marched out of Jerusalem in pursuit of Sheba son of Bichri. 
10020008	And while they were at the great stone in Gibeon, Amasa joined them. Now Joab was dressed in military attire, with a dagger strapped to his belt. And as he stepped forward, he slipped the dagger from its sheath. 
10020009	“Are you well, my brother?” Joab asked Amasa. And with his right hand Joab grabbed Amasa by the beard to kiss him. 
10020010	Amasa was not on guard against the dagger in Joab’s hand, and Joab stabbed him in the stomach and spilled out his intestines on the ground. And Joab did not need to strike him again, for Amasa was dead. Then Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba son of Bichri. 
10020011	One of Joab’s young men stood near Amasa and said, “Whoever favors Joab, and whoever is for David, let him follow Joab!” 
10020012	But Amasa wallowed in his blood in the middle of the road, and when the man saw that all the troops were stopping there, he dragged the body off the road into a field and threw a garment over it. 
10020013	As soon as Amasa’s body was removed from the road, all the men went on with Joab to pursue Sheba son of Bichri. 
10020014	Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel-beth-maacah and through the entire region of the Berites, who gathered together and followed him. 
10020015	And Joab’s troops came and besieged Sheba in Abel-beth-maacah and built a siege ramp against the outer rampart of the city. As all the troops with Joab were battering the wall to topple it, 
10020016	a wise woman called out from the city, “Listen! Listen! Please tell Joab to come here so that I may speak with him.” 
10020017	When he had come near to her, the woman asked, “Are you Joab?” “I am,” he replied. “Listen to the words of your servant,” she said. “I am listening,” he answered. 
10020018	Then the woman said, “Long ago they used to say, ‘Seek counsel at Abel,’ and that is how disputes were settled. 
10020019	I am among the peaceable and faithful in Israel, but you are trying to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel. Why would you swallow up the LORD’s inheritance?” 
10020020	“Far be it!” Joab declared. “Far be it from me to swallow up or destroy! 
10020021	That is not the case. But a man named Sheba son of Bichri, from the hill country of Ephraim, has lifted up his hand against the king, against David. Deliver him alone, and I will depart from the city.” “Look,” the woman replied, “his head will be thrown to you over the wall.” 
10020022	Then the woman went to all the people with her wise counsel, and they cut off the head of Sheba son of Bichri and threw it to Joab. So he blew the ram’s horn and his men dispersed from the city, each to his own home. And Joab returned to the king in Jerusalem. 
10020023	Now Joab was over the whole army of Israel; Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and Pelethites; 
10020024	Adoram was in charge of the forced labor; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder; 
10020025	Sheva was the scribe; Zadok and Abiathar were priests; 
10020026	and Ira the Jairite was David’s priest. 
10021001	During the reign of David there was a famine for three successive years, and David sought the face of the LORD. And the LORD said, “It is because of the blood shed by Saul and his family, because he killed the Gibeonites.” 
10021002	At this, David summoned the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not Israelites, but a remnant of the Amorites. The Israelites had taken an oath concerning them, but in his zeal for Israel and Judah, Saul had sought to kill them.) 
10021003	So David asked the Gibeonites, “What shall I do for you? How can I make amends so that you may bless the inheritance of the LORD?” 
10021004	The Gibeonites said to him, “We need no silver or gold from Saul or his house, nor should you put to death anyone in Israel for us.” “Whatever you ask, I will do for you,” he replied. 
10021005	And they answered the king, “As for the man who consumed us and plotted against us to exterminate us from existing within any border of Israel, 
10021006	let seven of his male descendants be delivered to us so that we may hang them before the LORD at Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of the LORD.” “I will give them to you,” said the king. 
10021007	Now the king spared Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath before the LORD between David and Jonathan son of Saul. 
10021008	But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons whom Rizpah daughter of Aiah had borne to Saul, as well as the five sons whom Merab daughter of Saul had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite. 
10021009	And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the hill before the LORD. So all seven of them fell together; they were put to death in the first days of the harvest, at the beginning of the barley harvest. 
10021010	And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on a rock. From the beginning of the harvest until the rain from heaven poured down on the bodies, she did not allow the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night. 
10021011	When David was told what Saul’s concubine Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, had done, 
10021012	he went and took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the public square of Beth-shan where the Philistines had hung the bodies after they had struck down Saul at Gilboa. 
10021013	So David had the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan brought from there, and they also gathered the bones of those who had been hanged. 
10021014	And they buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in Zela in the land of Benjamin, in the tomb of Saul’s father Kish. After they had done everything the king had commanded, God answered their prayers for the land. 
10021015	Once again the Philistines waged war against Israel, and David and his servants went down and fought against the Philistines. But David became exhausted. 
10021016	Then Ishbi-benob, a descendant of Rapha, whose bronze spear weighed three hundred shekels and who was bearing a new sword, resolved to kill David. 
10021017	But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to his aid, struck the Philistine, and killed him. Then David’s men swore to him, “You must never again go out with us to battle, so that the lamp of Israel may not be extinguished.” 
10021018	Some time later at Gob, there was another battle with the Philistines. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph, a descendant of Rapha. 
10021019	Once again there was a battle with the Philistines at Gob, and Elhanan son of Jair the Bethlehemite killed the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. 
10021020	And there was also a battle at Gath, where there was a man of great stature with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all. He too was descended from Rapha, 
10021021	and when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of David’s brother Shimei killed him. 
10021022	So these four descendants of Rapha in Gath fell at the hands of David and his servants. 
10022001	And David sang this song to the LORD on the day the LORD had delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. 
10022002	He said: “The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer. 
10022003	My God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation. My stronghold, my refuge, and my Savior, You save me from violence. 
10022004	I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised; so shall I be saved from my enemies. 
10022005	For the waves of death engulfed me; the torrents of chaos overwhelmed me. 
10022006	The cords of Sheol entangled me; the snares of death confronted me. 
10022007	In my distress I called upon the LORD; I cried out to my God. And from His temple He heard my voice, and my cry for help reached His ears. 
10022008	Then the earth shook and quaked; the foundations of the heavens trembled; they were shaken because He burned with anger. 
10022009	Smoke rose from His nostrils, and consuming fire came from His mouth; glowing coals blazed forth. 
10022010	He parted the heavens and came down with dark clouds beneath His feet. 
10022011	He mounted a cherub and flew; He soared on the wings of the wind. 
10022012	He made darkness a canopy around Him, a gathering of water and thick clouds. 
10022013	From the brightness of His presence coals of fire blazed forth. 
10022014	The LORD thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded. 
10022015	He shot His arrows and scattered the foes; He hurled lightning and routed them. 
10022016	The channels of the sea appeared, and the foundations of the world were exposed at the rebuke of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of His nostrils. 
10022017	He reached down from on high and took hold of me; He drew me out of deep waters. 
10022018	He rescued me from my powerful enemy, from foes too mighty for me. 
10022019	They confronted me in my day of calamity, but the LORD was my support. 
10022020	He brought me out into the open; He rescued me because He delighted in me. 
10022021	The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness; He has repaid me according to the cleanness of my hands. 
10022022	For I have kept the ways of the LORD and have not wickedly departed from my God. 
10022023	For all His ordinances are before me; I have not disregarded His statutes. 
10022024	And I have been blameless before Him and kept myself from iniquity. 
10022025	So the LORD has repaid me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness in His sight. 
10022026	To the faithful You show Yourself faithful, to the blameless You show Yourself blameless; 
10022027	to the pure You show Yourself pure, but to the crooked You show Yourself shrewd. 
10022028	You save an afflicted people, but Your eyes are on the haughty to bring them down. 
10022029	For You, O LORD, are my lamp; the LORD lights up my darkness. 
10022030	For in You I can charge an army; with my God I can scale a wall. 
10022031	As for God, His way is perfect; the word of the LORD is flawless. He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him. 
10022032	For who is God besides the LORD? And who is the Rock except our God? 
10022033	God is my strong fortress, and He makes my way clear. 
10022034	He makes my feet like those of a deer and stations me upon the heights. 
10022035	He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze. 
10022036	You have given me Your shield of salvation, and Your gentleness exalts me. 
10022037	You broaden the path beneath me so that my ankles do not give way. 
10022038	I pursued my enemies and destroyed them; I did not turn back until they were consumed. 
10022039	I devoured and crushed them so they could not rise; they have fallen under my feet. 
10022040	You have armed me with strength for battle; You have subdued my foes beneath me. 
10022041	You have made my enemies retreat before me; I destroyed those who hated me. 
10022042	They looked, but there was no one to save them— to the LORD, but He did not answer. 
10022043	I ground them as the dust of the earth; I crushed and trampled them like mud in the streets. 
10022044	You have delivered me from the strife of my people; You have preserved me as the head of nations; a people I had not known shall serve me. 
10022045	Foreigners cower before me; when they hear me, they obey me. 
10022046	Foreigners lose heart and come trembling from their strongholds. 
10022047	The LORD lives, and blessed be my Rock! And may God, the Rock of my salvation, be exalted— 
10022048	the God who avenges me and brings down nations beneath me, 
10022049	who frees me from my enemies. You exalt me above my foes; You rescue me from violent men. 
10022050	Therefore I will praise You, O LORD, among the nations; I will sing praises to Your name. 
10022051	Great salvation He brings to His king. He shows loving devotion to His anointed, to David and his descendants forever.” 
10023001	These are the last words of David: “The oracle of David son of Jesse, the oracle of the man raised on high, the one anointed by the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel: 
10023002	The Spirit of the LORD spoke through me; His word was on my tongue. 
10023003	The God of Israel spoke; the Rock of Israel said to me, ‘He who rules the people with justice, who rules in the fear of God, 
10023004	is like the light of the morning at sunrise of a cloudless dawn, the glistening after the rain on the sprouting grass of the earth.’ 
10023005	Is not my house right with God? For He has established with me an everlasting covenant, ordered and secured in every part. Will He not bring about my full salvation and my every desire? 
10023006	But the worthless are all like thorns raked aside, for they can never be gathered by hand. 
10023007	The man who touches them must be armed with iron or with the shaft of a spear. The fire burns them to ashes in the place where they lie.” 
10023008	These are the names of David’s mighty men: Josheb-basshebeth the Tahchemonite was chief of the Three. He wielded his spear against eight hundred men, whom he killed at one time. 
10023009	Next in command was Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite. As one of the three mighty men, he went with David to taunt the Philistines who had gathered for battle at Pas-dammim. The men of Israel retreated, 
10023010	but Eleazar stood his ground and struck the Philistines until his hand grew weary and stuck to his sword. The LORD brought about a great victory that day. Then the troops returned to him, but only to plunder the dead. 
10023011	And after him was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. When the Philistines had banded together near a field full of lentils, Israel’s troops fled from them. 
10023012	But Shammah took his stand in the middle of the field, defended it, and struck down the Philistines. So the LORD brought about a great victory. 
10023013	At harvest time, three of the thirty chief men went down to David at the cave of Adullam, while a company of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim. 
10023014	At that time David was in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was at Bethlehem. 
10023015	David longed for water and said, “Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!” 
10023016	So the three mighty men broke through the Philistine camp, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem, and brought it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out to the LORD, 
10023017	saying, “Far be it from me, O LORD, to do this! Is this not the blood of the men who risked their lives?” So he refused to drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty men. 
10023018	Now Abishai, the brother of Joab and son of Zeruiah, was chief of the Three, and he wielded his spear against three hundred men, killed them, and won a name along with the Three. 
10023019	Was he not more honored than the Three? And he became their commander, even though he was not included among the Three. 
10023020	And Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a man of valor from Kabzeel, a man of many exploits. He struck down two champions of Moab, and on a snowy day he went down into a pit and killed a lion. 
10023021	He also struck down an Egyptian, a huge man. Although the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club, snatched the spear from his hand, and killed the Egyptian with his own spear. 
10023022	These were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who won a name along with the three mighty men. 
10023023	He was most honored among the Thirty, but he did not become one of the Three. And David appointed him over his guard. 
10023024	Now these were members of the Thirty: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan son of Dodo of Bethlehem, 
10023025	Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite, 
10023026	Helez the Paltite, Ira son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, 
10023027	Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite, 
10023028	Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite, 
10023029	Heled son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai son of Ribai from Gibeah of the Benjamites, 
10023030	Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai from the brooks of Gaash, 
10023031	Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite, 
10023032	Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan 
10023033	son of Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam son of Sharar the Hararite, 
10023034	Eliphelet son of Ahasbai the Maacathite, Eliam son of Ahithophel the Gilonite, 
10023035	Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite, 
10023036	Igal son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite, 
10023037	Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, the armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah, 
10023038	Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 
10023039	and Uriah the Hittite. There were thirty-seven in all. 
10024001	Again the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He stirred up David against them, saying, “Go and take a census of Israel and Judah.” 
10024002	So the king said to Joab the commander of his army, who was with him, “Go now throughout the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and register the troops, so that I may know their number.” 
10024003	But Joab replied to the king, “May the LORD your God multiply the troops a hundred times over, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king want to do such a thing?” 
10024004	Nevertheless, the king’s word prevailed against Joab and against the commanders of the army. So Joab and the commanders of the army departed from the presence of the king to register the troops of Israel. 
10024005	They crossed the Jordan and camped near Aroer, south of the town in the middle of the valley, and proceeded toward Gad and Jazer. 
10024006	Then they went to Gilead and the land of Tahtim-hodshi, and on to Dan-jaan and around to Sidon. 
10024007	They went toward the fortress of Tyre and all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites. Finally, they went on to the Negev of Judah, to Beersheba. 
10024008	At the end of nine months and twenty days, having gone through the whole land, they returned to Jerusalem. 
10024009	And Joab reported to the king the total number of the troops. In Israel there were 800,000 men of valor who drew the sword, and in Judah there were 500,000. 
10024010	After David had numbered the troops, his conscience was stricken and he said to the LORD, “I have sinned greatly in what I have done. Now, O LORD, I beg You to take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.” 
10024011	When David got up in the morning, the word of the LORD had come to Gad the prophet, David’s seer: 
10024012	“Go and tell David that this is what the LORD says: ‘I am offering you three options. Choose one of them, and I will carry it out against you.’” 
10024013	So Gad went and said to David, “Do you choose to endure three years of famine in your land, three months of fleeing the pursuit of your enemies, or three days of plague upon your land? Now then, think it over and decide how I should reply to Him who sent me.” 
10024014	David answered Gad, “I am deeply distressed. Please, let us fall into the hand of the LORD, for His mercies are great; but do not let me fall into the hands of men.” 
10024015	So the LORD sent a plague upon Israel from that morning until the appointed time, and seventy thousand of the people from Dan to Beersheba died. 
10024016	But when the angel stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem, the LORD relented from the calamity and said to the angel who was destroying the people, “Enough! Withdraw your hand now!” At that time the angel of the LORD was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. 
10024017	When David saw the angel striking down the people, he said to the LORD, “Surely I, the shepherd, have sinned and acted wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? Please, let Your hand fall upon me and my father’s house.” 
10024018	And that day Gad came to David and said to him, “Go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.” 
10024019	So David went up at the word of Gad, just as the LORD had commanded. 
10024020	When Araunah looked out and saw the king and his servants coming toward him, he went out and bowed facedown before the king. 
10024021	“Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” Araunah said. “To buy your threshing floor,” David replied, “that I may build an altar to the LORD, so that the plague upon the people may be halted.” 
10024022	Araunah said to David, “May my lord the king take whatever seems good to him and offer it up. Here are the oxen for a burnt offering and the threshing sledges and ox yokes for the wood. 
10024023	O king, Araunah gives all these to the king.” He also said to the king, “May the LORD your God accept you.” 
10024024	“No,” replied the king, “I insist on paying a price, for I will not offer to the LORD my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing.” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. 
10024025	And there he built an altar to the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. Then the LORD answered the prayers on behalf of the land, and the plague upon Israel was halted. 
11001001	Now King David was old and well along in years, and though they covered him with blankets, he could not keep warm. 
11001002	So his servants said to him, “Let us search for a young virgin for our lord the king, to attend to him and care for him and lie by his side to keep him warm.” 
11001003	Then they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful girl, and they found Abishag the Shunammite and brought her to the king. 
11001004	The girl was unsurpassed in beauty; she cared for the king and served him, but he had no relations with her. 
11001005	At that time Adonijah, David’s son by Haggith, began to exalt himself, saying, “I will be king!” And he acquired chariots and horsemen and fifty men to run ahead of him. 
11001006	(His father had never once reprimanded him by saying, “Why do you act this way?” Adonijah was also very handsome, born next after Absalom.) 
11001007	So Adonijah conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, who supported him. 
11001008	But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David’s mighty men would not join Adonijah. 
11001009	And Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fattened calves near the stone of Zoheleth, which is next to En-rogel. He invited all his royal brothers and all the men of Judah who were servants of the king. 
11001010	But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, or his brother Solomon. 
11001011	Then Nathan said to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, “Have you not heard that Adonijah son of Haggith has become king, and our lord David does not know it? 
11001012	Now please, come and let me advise you. Save your own life and the life of your son Solomon. 
11001013	Go at once to King David and say, ‘My lord the king, did you not swear to your maidservant, “Surely your son Solomon will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne”? Why then has Adonijah become king?’ 
11001014	Then, while you are still there speaking with the king, I will come in after you and confirm your words.” 
11001015	So Bathsheba went to see the king in his bedroom. Since the king was very old, Abishag the Shunammite was serving him. 
11001016	And Bathsheba bowed down in homage to the king, who asked, “What is your desire?” 
11001017	“My lord,” she replied, “you yourself swore to your maidservant by the LORD your God: ‘Surely your son Solomon will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne.’ 
11001018	But now, behold, Adonijah has become king, and you, my lord the king, do not know it. 
11001019	And he has sacrificed an abundance of oxen, fattened calves, and sheep, and has invited all the other sons of the king, as well as Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army. But he has not invited your servant Solomon. 
11001020	And as for you, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you to tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. 
11001021	Otherwise, when my lord the king rests with his fathers, I and my son Solomon will be counted as criminals.” 
11001022	And just then, while Bathsheba was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet arrived. 
11001023	So the king was told, “Nathan the prophet is here.” And Nathan went in and bowed facedown before the king. 
11001024	“My lord the king,” said Nathan, “did you say, ‘Adonijah will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne’? 
11001025	For today he has gone down and sacrificed an abundance of oxen, fattened calves, and sheep, and has invited all the sons of the king, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest. And behold, they are eating and drinking before him, saying, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’ 
11001026	But me your servant he has not invited, nor Zadok the priest, nor Benaiah son of Jehoiada, nor your servant Solomon. 
11001027	Has my lord the king let this happen without informing your servant who should sit on the throne after my lord the king?” 
11001028	Then King David said, “Call in Bathsheba for me.” So she came into the king’s presence and stood before him. 
11001029	And the king swore an oath, saying, “As surely as the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life from all distress, 
11001030	I will carry out this very day exactly what I swore to you by the LORD, the God of Israel: Surely your son Solomon will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne in my place.” 
11001031	Bathsheba bowed facedown in homage to the king and said, “May my lord King David live forever!” 
11001032	Then King David said, “Call in for me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada.” So they came before the king. 
11001033	“Take my servants with you,” said the king. “Set my son Solomon on my own mule and take him down to Gihon. 
11001034	There Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet are to anoint him king over Israel. You are to blow the ram’s horn and declare, ‘Long live King Solomon!’ 
11001035	Then you shall go up with him, and he is to come and sit on my throne and reign in my place. For I have appointed him ruler over Israel and Judah.” 
11001036	“Amen,” replied Benaiah son of Jehoiada. “May the LORD, the God of my lord the king, so declare it. 
11001037	Just as the LORD was with my lord the king, so may He be with Solomon and make his throne even greater than that of my lord King David.” 
11001038	Then Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, along with the Cherethites and Pelethites, went down and set Solomon on King David’s mule, and they escorted him to Gihon. 
11001039	Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tabernacle and anointed Solomon. Then they blew the ram’s horn, and all the people proclaimed, “Long live King Solomon!” 
11001040	All the people followed him, playing flutes and rejoicing with such a great joy that the earth was split by the sound. 
11001041	Now Adonijah and all his guests were finishing their feast when they heard the sound of the ram’s horn. “Why is the city in such a loud uproar?” asked Joab. 
11001042	As he was speaking, suddenly Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest arrived. “Come in,” said Adonijah, “for you are a man of valor. You must be bringing good news.” 
11001043	“Not at all,” Jonathan replied. “Our lord King David has made Solomon king. 
11001044	And with Solomon, the king has sent Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, along with the Cherethites and Pelethites, and they have set him on the king’s mule. 
11001045	Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon, and they have gone up from there with rejoicing that rings out in the city. That is the noise you hear. 
11001046	Moreover, Solomon has taken his seat on the royal throne. 
11001047	The king’s servants have also gone to congratulate our lord King David, saying, ‘May your God make the name of Solomon more famous than your own name, and may He make his throne greater than your throne.’ And the king has bowed in worship on his bed, 
11001048	saying, ‘Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel! Today He has provided one to sit on my throne, and my eyes have seen it.’” 
11001049	At this, all the guests of Adonijah arose in terror and scattered. 
11001050	But Adonijah, in fear of Solomon, got up and went to take hold of the horns of the altar. 
11001051	It was reported to Solomon: “Behold, Adonijah fears King Solomon, and he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solomon first swear to me not to put his servant to the sword.’” 
11001052	And Solomon replied, “If he is a man of character, not a single hair of his will fall to the ground. But if evil is found in him, he will die.” 
11001053	So King Solomon summoned Adonijah down from the altar, and he came and bowed down before King Solomon, who said to him, “Go to your home.” 
11002001	As the time drew near for David to die, he charged his son Solomon, 
11002002	“I am about to go the way of all the earth. So be strong and prove yourself a man. 
11002003	And keep the charge of the LORD your God to walk in His ways and to keep His statutes, commandments, ordinances, and decrees, as written in the Law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you turn, 
11002004	and so that the LORD may fulfill His promise to me: ‘If your descendants take heed to walk faithfully before Me with all their heart and soul, you will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.’ 
11002005	Moreover, you know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me—what he did to Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether, the two commanders of the armies of Israel. He killed them in peacetime to avenge the blood of war. He stained with the blood of war the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet. 
11002006	So act according to your wisdom, and do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace. 
11002007	But show loving devotion to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table, because they stood by me when I fled from your brother Absalom. 
11002008	Keep an eye on Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim who is with you. He called down bitter curses against me on the day I went to Mahanaim, but when he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the LORD: ‘I will never put you to the sword.’ 
11002009	Now therefore, do not hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man. You know what you ought to do to him to bring his gray head down to Sheol in blood.” 
11002010	Then David rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. 
11002011	The length of David’s reign over Israel was forty years—seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. 
11002012	So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was firmly established. 
11002013	Now Adonijah son of Haggith went to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, and she asked, “Do you come in peace?” “Yes, in peace,” he replied. 
11002014	Then he said, “I have something to tell you.” “Say it,” she answered. 
11002015	“You know that the kingship was mine,” he said. “All Israel expected that I should reign, but the kingship has turned to my brother, for it has come to him from the LORD. 
11002016	So now I have just one request of you; do not deny me.” “State your request,” she told him. 
11002017	Adonijah replied, “Please speak to King Solomon, since he will not turn you down. Let him give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife.” 
11002018	“Very well,” Bathsheba replied. “I will speak to the king for you.” 
11002019	So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah. The king stood up to greet her, bowed to her, and sat down on his throne. Then the king had a throne brought for his mother, who sat down at his right hand. 
11002020	“I have just one small request of you,” she said. “Do not deny me.” “Make your request, my mother,” the king replied, “for I will not deny you.” 
11002021	So Bathsheba said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to your brother Adonijah as his wife.” 
11002022	King Solomon answered his mother, “Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Since he is my older brother, you might as well request the kingdom for him and for Abiathar the priest and for Joab son of Zeruiah!” 
11002023	Then King Solomon swore by the LORD: “May God punish me, and ever so severely, if Adonijah has not made this request at the expense of his life. 
11002024	And now, as surely as the LORD lives—the One who established me, who set me on the throne of my father David, and who founded for me a dynasty as He promised—surely Adonijah shall be put to death today!” 
11002025	So King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he struck down Adonijah and he died. 
11002026	Then the king said to Abiathar the priest, “Go back to your fields in Anathoth. Even though you deserve to die, I will not put you to death at this time, since you carried the ark of the Lord GOD before my father David, and you suffered through all that my father suffered.” 
11002027	So Solomon banished Abiathar from the priesthood of the LORD and thus fulfilled the word that the LORD had spoken at Shiloh against the house of Eli. 
11002028	When the news reached Joab, who had conspired with Adonijah but not with Absalom, he fled to the tent of the LORD and took hold of the horns of the altar. 
11002029	It was reported to King Solomon: “Joab has fled to the tent of the LORD and is now beside the altar.” So Solomon sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada, saying, “Go, strike him down!” 
11002030	And Benaiah entered the tent of the LORD and said to Joab, “The king says, ‘Come out!’” But Joab replied, “No, I will die here.” So Benaiah relayed the message to the king, saying, “This is how Joab answered me.” 
11002031	And the king replied, “Do just as he says. Strike him down and bury him, and so remove from me and from the house of my father the innocent blood that Joab shed. 
11002032	The LORD will bring his bloodshed back upon his own head, for without the knowledge of my father David he struck down two men more righteous and better than he when he put to the sword Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel’s army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah’s army. 
11002033	Their blood will come back upon the heads of Joab and his descendants forever; but for David, his descendants, his house, and his throne, there shall be peace from the LORD forever.” 
11002034	So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up, struck down Joab, and killed him. He was buried at his own home in the wilderness. 
11002035	And the king appointed Benaiah son of Jehoiada in Joab’s place over the army, and he appointed Zadok the priest in Abiathar’s place. 
11002036	Then the king summoned Shimei and said to him, “Build a house for yourself in Jerusalem and live there, but do not go anywhere else. 
11002037	On the day you go out and cross the Kidron Valley, know for sure that you will die; your blood will be on your own head.” 
11002038	“The sentence is fair,” Shimei replied. “Your servant will do as my lord the king has spoken.” And Shimei lived in Jerusalem for a long time. 
11002039	After three years, however, two of Shimei’s slaves ran away to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath. And Shimei was told, “Look, your slaves are in Gath.” 
11002040	So Shimei saddled his donkey and set out to Achish at Gath in search of his slaves, and he brought them back from Gath. 
11002041	When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned, 
11002042	the king summoned Shimei and said to him, “Did I not make you swear by the LORD and warn you, ‘On the day you leave and go elsewhere, know for sure that you will die’? And you told me, ‘The sentence is fair; I will comply.’ 
11002043	So why have you not kept your oath to the LORD and the command that I gave you?” 
11002044	The king also said, “You know in your heart all the evil that you did to my father David. Therefore the LORD will bring your evil back upon your head. 
11002045	But King Solomon will be blessed and David’s throne will remain secure before the LORD forever.” 
11002046	Then the king commanded Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck Shimei down, and he died. Thus the kingdom was firmly established in the hand of Solomon. 
11003001	Later, Solomon formed an alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt by marrying his daughter. Solomon brought her to the City of David until he had finished building his palace and the house of the LORD, as well as the wall around Jerusalem. 
11003002	The people, however, were still sacrificing on the high places because a house for the Name of the LORD had not yet been built. 
11003003	And Solomon loved the LORD and walked in the statutes of his father David, except that he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. 
11003004	Now the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for it was the great high place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on the altar there. 
11003005	One night at Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream, and God said, “Ask, and I will give it to you!” 
11003006	Solomon replied, “You have shown much loving devotion to Your servant, my father David, because he walked before You in faithfulness, righteousness, and uprightness of heart. And You have maintained this loving devotion by giving him a son to sit on his throne this very day. 
11003007	And now, O LORD my God, You have made Your servant king in my father David’s place. But I am only a little child, not knowing how to go out or come in. 
11003008	Your servant is here among the people You have chosen, a people too numerous to count or number. 
11003009	Therefore give Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people and to discern between good and evil. For who is able to govern this great people of Yours?” 
11003010	Now it pleased the Lord that Solomon had made this request. 
11003011	So God said to him, “Since you have asked for this instead of requesting long life or wealth for yourself or death for your enemies—but you have asked for discernment to administer justice— 
11003012	behold, I will do what you have asked. I will give you a wise and discerning heart, so that there will never have been another like you, nor will there ever be. 
11003013	Moreover, I will give you what you did not request—both riches and honor—so that during all your days no man in any kingdom will be your equal. 
11003014	So if you walk in My ways and keep My statutes and commandments, just as your father David did, I will prolong your days.” 
11003015	Then Solomon awoke, and indeed it had been a dream. So he returned to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. Then he held a feast for all his servants. 
11003016	At that time two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him. 
11003017	One woman said, “Please, my lord, this woman and I live in the same house, and I gave birth while she was in the house. 
11003018	On the third day after I gave birth, this woman also had a baby. We were alone, with no one in the house but the two of us. 
11003019	During the night this woman’s son died because she rolled over on him. 
11003020	So she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while I was asleep. She laid him in her bosom and put her dead son at my bosom. 
11003021	The next morning, when I got up to nurse my son, I discovered he was dead. But when I examined him, I realized that he was not the son I had borne.” 
11003022	“No,” said the other woman, “the living one is my son and the dead one is your son.” But the first woman insisted, “No, the dead one is yours and the living one is mine.” So they argued before the king. 
11003023	Then the king replied, “This woman says, ‘My son is alive and yours is dead,’ but that woman says, ‘No, your son is dead and mine is alive.’” 
11003024	The king continued, “Bring me a sword.” So they brought him a sword, 
11003025	and the king declared, “Cut the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other.” 
11003026	Then the woman whose son was alive spoke to the king because she yearned with compassion for her son. “Please, my lord,” she said, “give her the living baby. Do not kill him!” But the other woman said, “He will be neither mine nor yours. Cut him in two!” 
11003027	Then the king gave his ruling: “Give the living baby to the first woman. By no means should you kill him; she is his mother.” 
11003028	When all Israel heard of the judgment the king had given, they stood in awe of him, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to administer justice. 
11004001	So King Solomon ruled over Israel, 
11004002	and these were his chief officials: Azariah son of Zadok was the priest; 
11004003	Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, were secretaries; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder; 
11004004	Benaiah son of Jehoiada was in charge of the army; Zadok and Abiathar were priests; 
11004005	Azariah son of Nathan was in charge of the governors; Zabud son of Nathan was a priest and adviser to the king; 
11004006	Ahishar was in charge of the palace; and Adoniram son of Abda was in charge of the forced labor. 
11004007	Solomon had twelve governors over all Israel to provide food for the king and his household. Each one would arrange provisions for one month of the year, 
11004008	and these were their names: Ben-hur in the hill country of Ephraim; 
11004009	Ben-deker in Makaz, in Shaalbim, in Beth-shemesh, and in Elon-beth-hanan; 
11004010	Ben-hesed in Arubboth (Socoh and all the land of Hepher belonged to him); 
11004011	Ben-abinadab in Naphath-dor (Taphath, a daughter of Solomon, was his wife); 
11004012	Baana son of Ahilud in Taanach, in Megiddo, and in all of Beth-shean next to Zarethan below Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah and on past Jokmeam; 
11004013	Ben-geber in Ramoth-gilead (the villages of Jair son of Manasseh in Gilead belonged to him, as well as the region of Argob in Bashan with its sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars); 
11004014	Ahinadab son of Iddo in Mahanaim; 
11004015	Ahimaaz in Naphtali (he had married Basemath, a daughter of Solomon); 
11004016	Baana son of Hushai in Asher and in Aloth; 
11004017	Jehoshaphat son of Paruah in Issachar; 
11004018	Shimei son of Ela in Benjamin; 
11004019	Geber son of Uri in the land of Gilead, including the territories of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan. There was also one governor in the land of Judah. 
11004020	The people of Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand on the seashore, and they were eating and drinking and rejoicing. 
11004021	And Solomon reigned over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. These kingdoms offered tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life. 
11004022	Solomon’s provisions for a single day were thirty cors of fine flour, sixty cors of meal, 
11004023	ten fat oxen, twenty range oxen, and a hundred sheep, as well as deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fattened poultry. 
11004024	For Solomon had dominion over everything west of the Euphrates —over all the kingdoms from Tiphsah to Gaza—and he had peace on all sides. 
11004025	Throughout the days of Solomon, Judah and Israel dwelt securely from Dan to Beersheba, each man under his own vine and his own fig tree. 
11004026	Solomon had 4,000 stalls for his chariot horses and 12,000 horses. 
11004027	Each month the governors in turn provided food for King Solomon and all who came to his table. They saw to it that nothing was lacking. 
11004028	Each one also brought to the required place their quotas of barley and straw for the chariot horses and other horses. 
11004029	And God gave Solomon wisdom, exceedingly deep insight, and understanding beyond measure, like the sand on the seashore. 
11004030	Solomon’s wisdom was greater than that of all the men of the East, greater than all the wisdom of Egypt. 
11004031	He was wiser than all men—wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and wiser than Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And his fame spread throughout the surrounding nations. 
11004032	Solomon composed three thousand proverbs, and his songs numbered a thousand and five. 
11004033	He spoke of trees, from the cedar in Lebanon to the hyssop growing in the wall, and he taught about animals, birds, reptiles, and fish. 
11004034	So men of all nations came to listen to Solomon’s wisdom, sent by all the kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom. 
11005001	Now when Hiram king of Tyre heard that Solomon had been anointed king in his father’s place, he sent envoys to Solomon; for Hiram had always been a friend of David. 
11005002	And Solomon relayed this message to Hiram: 
11005003	“As you are well aware, due to the wars waged on all sides against my father David, he could not build a house for the Name of the LORD his God until the LORD had put his enemies under his feet. 
11005004	But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side, and there is no adversary or crisis. 
11005005	So behold, I plan to build a house for the Name of the LORD my God, according to what the LORD said to my father David: ‘I will put your son on your throne in your place, and he will build the house for My Name.’ 
11005006	Now therefore, order that cedars of Lebanon be cut down for me. My servants will be with your servants, and I will pay your servants whatever wages you set, for you know that there are none among us as skilled in logging as the Sidonians.” 
11005007	When Hiram received Solomon’s message, he rejoiced greatly and said, “Blessed be the LORD this day! He has given David a wise son over this great people!” 
11005008	Then Hiram sent a reply to Solomon, saying: “I have received your message; I will do all you desire regarding the cedar and cypress timber. 
11005009	My servants will haul the logs from Lebanon to the Sea, and I will float them as rafts by sea to the place you specify. There I will separate the logs, and you can take them away. And in exchange, you can meet my needs by providing my household with food.” 
11005010	So Hiram provided Solomon with all the cedar and cypress timber he wanted, 
11005011	and year after year Solomon would provide Hiram with 20,000 cors of wheat as food for his household, as well as 20,000 baths of pure olive oil. 
11005012	And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as He had promised him. There was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty. 
11005013	Then King Solomon conscripted a labor force of 30,000 men from all Israel. 
11005014	He sent them to Lebanon in monthly shifts of 10,000 men, so that they would spend one month in Lebanon and two months at home. And Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor. 
11005015	Solomon had 70,000 porters and 80,000 stonecutters in the mountains, 
11005016	not including his 3,300 foremen who supervised the workers. 
11005017	And the king commanded them to quarry large, costly stones to lay the foundation of the temple with dressed stones. 
11005018	So Solomon’s and Hiram’s builders, along with the Gebalites, quarried the stone and prepared the timber and stone for the construction of the temple. 
11006001	In the four hundred and eightieth year after the Israelites had come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, the second month, he began to build the house of the LORD. 
11006002	The house that King Solomon built for the LORD was sixty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high. 
11006003	The portico at the front of the main hall of the temple was twenty cubits long, extending across the width of the temple and projecting out ten cubits in front of the temple. 
11006004	He also had narrow windows framed high in the temple. 
11006005	Against the walls of the temple and the inner sanctuary, Solomon built a chambered structure around the temple, in which he constructed the side rooms. 
11006006	The bottom floor was five cubits wide, the middle floor six cubits, and the third floor seven cubits. He also placed offset ledges around the outside of the temple, so that nothing would be inserted into its walls. 
11006007	The temple was constructed using finished stones cut at the quarry, so that no hammer or chisel or any other iron tool was heard in the temple while it was being built. 
11006008	The entrance to the bottom floor was on the south side of the temple. A stairway led up to the middle level, and from there to the third floor. 
11006009	So Solomon built the temple and finished it, roofing it with beams and planks of cedar. 
11006010	He built chambers all along the temple, each five cubits high and attached to the temple with beams of cedar. 
11006011	Then the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying: 
11006012	“As for this temple you are building, if you walk in My statutes, carry out My ordinances, and keep all My commandments by walking in them, I will fulfill through you the promise I made to your father David. 
11006013	And I will dwell among the Israelites and will not abandon My people Israel.” 
11006014	So Solomon built the temple and finished it. 
11006015	He lined the interior walls with cedar paneling from the floor of the temple to the ceiling, and he covered the floor with cypress boards. 
11006016	He partitioned off the twenty cubits at the rear of the temple with cedar boards from floor to ceiling to form within the temple an inner sanctuary, the Most Holy Place. 
11006017	And the main hall in front of this room was forty cubits long. 
11006018	The cedar paneling inside the temple was carved with gourds and open flowers. Everything was cedar; not a stone could be seen. 
11006019	Solomon also prepared the inner sanctuary within the temple to set the ark of the covenant of the LORD there. 
11006020	The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold, and he also overlaid the altar of cedar. 
11006021	So Solomon overlaid the inside of the temple with pure gold, and he extended gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary, which was overlaid with gold. 
11006022	So he overlaid with gold the whole interior of the temple, until everything was completely finished. He also overlaid with gold the entire altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary. 
11006023	In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim, each ten cubits high, out of olive wood. 
11006024	One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long, and the other wing was five cubits long as well. So the full wingspan was ten cubits. 
11006025	The second cherub also measured ten cubits; both cherubim had the same size and shape, 
11006026	and the height of each cherub was ten cubits. 
11006027	And he placed the cherubim inside the innermost room of the temple. Since their wings were spread out, the wing of the first cherub touched one wall, while the wing of the second cherub touched the other wall, and in the middle of the room their wingtips touched. 
11006028	He also overlaid the cherubim with gold. 
11006029	Then he carved the walls all around the temple, in both the inner and outer sanctuaries, with carved engravings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers. 
11006030	And he overlaid the temple floor with gold in both the inner and outer sanctuaries. 
11006031	For the entrance to the inner sanctuary, Solomon constructed doors of olive wood with five-sided doorposts. 
11006032	The double doors were made of olive wood, and he carved into them cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers and overlaid the cherubim and palm trees with hammered gold. 
11006033	In the same way he made four-sided doorposts of olive wood for the sanctuary entrance. 
11006034	The two doors were made of cypress wood, and each had two folding panels. 
11006035	He carved into them cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, and he overlaid them with gold hammered evenly over the carvings. 
11006036	Solomon built the inner courtyard with three rows of dressed stone and one row of trimmed cedar beams. 
11006037	The foundation of the house of the LORD was laid in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign, in the month of Ziv. 
11006038	In the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, the eighth month, the temple was finished in every detail and according to every specification. So he built the temple in seven years. 
11007001	Solomon, however, took thirteen years to complete the construction of his entire palace. 
11007002	He built the House of the Forest of Lebanon a hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high, with four rows of cedar pillars supporting the cedar beams. 
11007003	The house was roofed with cedar above the beams that rested on the pillars—forty-five beams, fifteen per row. 
11007004	There were three rows of high windows facing one another in three tiers. 
11007005	All the doorways had rectangular frames, with the openings facing one another in three tiers. 
11007006	Solomon made his colonnade fifty cubits long and thirty cubits wide, with a portico in front of it and a canopy with pillars in front of the portico. 
11007007	In addition, he built a hall for the throne, the Hall of Justice, where he was to judge. It was paneled with cedar from floor to ceiling. 
11007008	And the palace where Solomon would live, set further back, was of similar construction. He also made a palace like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had married. 
11007009	All these buildings were constructed with costly stones, cut to size and trimmed with saws inside and out from the foundation to the eaves, and from the outside to the great courtyard. 
11007010	The foundations were laid with large, costly stones, some ten cubits long and some eight cubits long. 
11007011	Above these were costly stones, cut to size, and cedar beams. 
11007012	The great courtyard was surrounded by three rows of dressed stone and a row of trimmed cedar beams, as were the inner courtyard and portico of the house of the LORD. 
11007013	Now King Solomon sent to bring Huram from Tyre. 
11007014	He was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a craftsman in bronze. Huram had great skill, understanding, and knowledge for every kind of bronze work. So he came to King Solomon and carried out all his work. 
11007015	He cast two pillars of bronze, each eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference. 
11007016	He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on top of the pillars, each capital five cubits high. 
11007017	For the capitals on top of the pillars he made a network of lattice, with wreaths of chainwork, seven for each capital. 
11007018	Likewise, he made the pillars with two rows of pomegranates around each grating to cover each capital atop the pillars. 
11007019	And the capitals atop the pillars in the portico were shaped like lilies, four cubits high. 
11007020	On the capitals of both pillars, just above the rounded projection next to the network, were the two hundred pomegranates in rows encircling each capital. 
11007021	Thus he set up the pillars at the portico of the temple. The pillar to the south he named Jachin, and the pillar to the north he named Boaz. 
11007022	And the tops of the pillars were shaped like lilies. So the work of the pillars was completed. 
11007023	He also made the Sea of cast metal. It was circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim, five cubits in height, and thirty cubits in circumference. 
11007024	Below the rim, ornamental buds encircled it, ten per cubit all the way around the Sea, cast in two rows as a part of the Sea. 
11007025	The Sea stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The Sea rested on them, with all their hindquarters toward the center. 
11007026	It was a handbreadth thick, and its rim was fashioned like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It could hold two thousand baths. 
11007027	In addition, he made ten movable stands of bronze, each four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high. 
11007028	This was the design of the stands: They had side panels attached to uprights, 
11007029	and on the panels between the uprights were lions, oxen, and cherubim. On the uprights was a pedestal above, and below the lions and oxen were wreaths of beveled work. 
11007030	Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles and a basin resting on four supports, with wreaths at each side. 
11007031	The opening to each stand inside the crown at the top was one cubit deep, with a round opening like the design of a pedestal, a cubit and a half wide. And around its opening were engravings, but the panels of the stands were square, not round. 
11007032	There were four wheels under the panels, and the axles of the wheels were attached to the stand; each wheel was a cubit and a half in diameter. 
11007033	The wheels were made like chariot wheels; their axles, rims, spokes, and hubs were all of cast metal. 
11007034	Each stand had four handles, one for each corner, projecting from the stand. 
11007035	At the top of each stand was a circular band half a cubit high. The supports and panels were cast as a unit with the top of the stand. 
11007036	He engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees on the surfaces of the supports and panels, wherever each had space, with wreaths all around. 
11007037	In this way he made the ten stands, each with the same casting, dimensions, and shape. 
11007038	He also made ten bronze basins, each holding forty baths and measuring four cubits across, one basin for each of the ten stands. 
11007039	He set five stands on the south side of the temple and five on the north, and he put the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner of the temple. 
11007040	Additionally, Huram made the pots, shovels, and sprinkling bowls. So Huram finished all the work that he had undertaken for King Solomon in the house of the LORD: 
11007041	the two pillars; the two bowl-shaped capitals atop the pillars; the two sets of network covering both bowls of the capitals atop the pillars; 
11007042	the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network covering both the bowl-shaped capitals atop the pillars); 
11007043	the ten stands; the ten basins on the stands; 
11007044	the Sea; the twelve oxen underneath the Sea; 
11007045	and the pots, shovels, and sprinkling bowls. All the articles that Huram made for King Solomon in the house of the LORD were made of burnished bronze. 
11007046	The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Succoth and Zarethan. 
11007047	Solomon left all these articles unweighed, because there were so many. The weight of the bronze could not be determined. 
11007048	Solomon also made all the furnishings for the house of the LORD: the golden altar; the golden table on which was placed the Bread of the Presence; 
11007049	the lampstands of pure gold in front of the inner sanctuary, five on the right side and five on the left; the gold flowers, lamps, and tongs; 
11007050	the pure gold basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, ladles, and censers; and the gold hinges for the doors of the inner temple (that is, the Most Holy Place ) as well as for the doors of the main hall of the temple. 
11007051	So all the work that King Solomon had performed for the house of the LORD was completed. Then Solomon brought in the items his father David had dedicated—the silver, the gold, and the furnishings—and he placed them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD. 
11008001	At that time Solomon assembled before him in Jerusalem the elders of Israel—all the tribal heads and family leaders of the Israelites—to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from Zion, the City of David. 
11008002	And all the men of Israel came together to King Solomon at the feast in the seventh month, the month of Ethanim. 
11008003	When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the priests took up the ark, 
11008004	and they brought up the ark of the LORD and the Tent of Meeting with all its sacred furnishings. So the priests and Levites carried them up. 
11008005	There, before the ark, King Solomon and the whole congregation of Israel who had assembled with him sacrificed so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered. 
11008006	Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, beneath the wings of the cherubim. 
11008007	For the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and overshadowed the ark and its poles. 
11008008	The poles extended far enough that their ends were visible from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are there to this day. 
11008009	There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the LORD had made a covenant with the Israelites after they had come out of the land of Egypt. 
11008010	And when the priests came out of the Holy Place, the cloud filled the house of the LORD 
11008011	so that the priests could not stand there to minister because of the cloud. For the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD. 
11008012	Then Solomon declared: “The LORD has said that He would dwell in the thick cloud. 
11008013	I have indeed built You an exalted house, a place for You to dwell forever.” 
11008014	And as the whole assembly of Israel stood there, the king turned around and blessed them all 
11008015	and said: “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who has fulfilled with His own hand what He spoke with His mouth to my father David, saying, 
11008016	‘Since the day I brought My people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city from any tribe of Israel in which to build a house so that My Name would be there. But I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.’ 
11008017	Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a house for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel. 
11008018	But the LORD said to my father David, ‘Since it was in your heart to build a house for My Name, you have done well to have this in your heart. 
11008019	Nevertheless, you are not the one to build it; but your son, your own offspring, will build the house for My Name.’ 
11008020	Now the LORD has fulfilled the word that He spoke. I have succeeded my father David, and I sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised. I have built the house for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel. 
11008021	And there I have provided a place for the ark, which contains the covenant of the LORD that He made with our fathers when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.” 
11008022	Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the whole assembly of Israel, spread out his hands toward heaven, 
11008023	and said: “O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like You in heaven above or on earth below, keeping Your covenant of loving devotion with Your servants who walk before You with all their hearts. 
11008024	You have kept Your promise to Your servant, my father David. What You spoke with Your mouth You have fulfilled with Your hand this day. 
11008025	Therefore now, O LORD, God of Israel, keep for Your servant, my father David, what You promised when You said: ‘You will never fail to have a man to sit before Me on the throne of Israel, if only your descendants guard their way to walk before Me as you have done.’ 
11008026	And now, O God of Israel, please confirm what You promised to Your servant, my father David. 
11008027	But will God indeed dwell upon the earth? The heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain You, much less this temple I have built. 
11008028	Yet regard the prayer and plea of Your servant, O LORD my God, so that You may hear the cry and the prayer that Your servant is praying before You today. 
11008029	May Your eyes be open toward this temple night and day, toward the place of which You said, ‘My Name shall be there,’ so that You may hear the prayer that Your servant prays toward this place. 
11008030	Hear the plea of Your servant and of Your people Israel when they pray toward this place. May You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place. May You hear and forgive. 
11008031	When a man sins against his neighbor and is required to take an oath, and he comes to take an oath before Your altar in this temple, 
11008032	then may You hear from heaven and act. May You judge Your servants, condemning the wicked man by bringing down on his own head what he has done, and justifying the righteous man by rewarding him according to his righteousness. 
11008033	When Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against You, and they return to You and confess Your name, praying and pleading with You in this temple, 
11008034	then may You hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel. May You restore them to the land You gave to their fathers. 
11008035	When the skies are shut and there is no rain because Your people have sinned against You, and they pray toward this place and confess Your name, and they turn from their sins because You have afflicted them, 
11008036	then may You hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Israel, so that You may teach them the good way in which they should walk. May You send rain on the land that You gave Your people as an inheritance. 
11008037	When famine or plague comes upon the land, or blight or mildew or locusts or grasshoppers, or when their enemy besieges them in their cities, whatever plague or sickness may come, 
11008038	then may whatever prayer or petition Your people Israel make—each knowing his own afflictions and spreading out his hands toward this temple— 
11008039	be heard by You from heaven, Your dwelling place. And may You forgive and act, and repay each man according to all his ways, since You know his heart—for You alone know the hearts of all men— 
11008040	so that they may fear You all the days they live in the land that You gave to our fathers. 
11008041	And as for the foreigner who is not of Your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of Your name— 
11008042	for they will hear of Your great name and mighty hand and outstretched arm—when he comes and prays toward this temple, 
11008043	then may You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You. Then all the peoples of the earth will know Your name and fear You, as do Your people Israel, and they will know that this house I have built is called by Your Name. 
11008044	When Your people go to war against their enemies, wherever You send them, and when they pray to the LORD in the direction of the city You have chosen and the house I have built for Your Name, 
11008045	then may You hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and may You uphold their cause. 
11008046	When they sin against You—for there is no one who does not sin—and You become angry with them and deliver them to an enemy who takes them as captives to his own land, whether far or near, 
11008047	and when they come to their senses in the land to which they were taken, and they repent and plead with You in the land of their captors, saying, ‘We have sinned and done wrong; we have acted wickedly,’ 
11008048	and when they return to You with all their heart and soul in the land of the enemies who took them captive, and when they pray to You in the direction of the land that You gave to their fathers, the city You have chosen, and the house I have built for Your Name, 
11008049	then may You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place, their prayer and petition, and may You uphold their cause. 
11008050	May You forgive Your people who have sinned against You and all the transgressions they have committed against You, and may You grant them compassion in the eyes of their captors to show them mercy. 
11008051	For they are Your people and Your inheritance; You brought them out of Egypt, out of the furnace for iron. 
11008052	May Your eyes be open to the pleas of Your servant and of Your people Israel, and may You listen to them whenever they call to You. 
11008053	For You, O Lord GOD, have set them apart from all the peoples of the earth as Your inheritance, as You spoke through Your servant Moses when You brought our fathers out of Egypt.” 
11008054	Now when Solomon had finished praying this entire prayer and petition to the LORD, he got up before the altar of the LORD, where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out toward heaven. 
11008055	And he stood and blessed the whole assembly of Israel in a loud voice, saying: 
11008056	“Blessed be the LORD, who has given rest to His people Israel according to all that He promised. Not one word has failed of all the good promises He made through His servant Moses. 
11008057	May the LORD our God be with us, as He was with our fathers. May He never leave us or forsake us. 
11008058	May He incline our hearts to Himself, to walk in all His ways and to keep the commandments and statutes and ordinances He commanded our fathers. 
11008059	And may these words with which I have made my petition before the LORD be near to the LORD our God day and night, so that He may uphold the cause of His servant and of His people Israel as each day requires, 
11008060	so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD is God. There is no other! 
11008061	So let your heart be fully devoted to the LORD our God, as it is this day, to walk in His statutes and to keep His commandments.” 
11008062	Then the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices before the LORD. 
11008063	And Solomon offered as peace offerings to the LORD 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the Israelites dedicated the house of the LORD. 
11008064	On that same day the king consecrated the middle of the courtyard in front of the house of the LORD, and there he offered the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, since the bronze altar before the LORD was too small to contain all these offerings. 
11008065	So at that time Solomon and all Israel with him—a great assembly of people from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of Egypt—kept the feast before the LORD our God for seven days and seven more days—fourteen days in all. 
11008066	On the fifteenth day Solomon sent the people away. So they blessed the king and went home, joyful and glad in heart for all the good things that the LORD had done for His servant David and for His people Israel. 
11009001	Now when Solomon had finished building the house of the LORD and the royal palace, and had achieved all that he had desired to do, 
11009002	the LORD appeared to him a second time, as He had appeared to him at Gibeon. 
11009003	And the LORD said to him: “I have heard your prayer and petition before Me. I have consecrated this temple, which you have built, by putting My Name there forever; My eyes and My heart will be there for all time. 
11009004	And as for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, with a heart of integrity and uprightness, doing all I have commanded you, and if you keep My statutes and ordinances, 
11009005	then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised your father David when I said, ‘You will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.’ 
11009006	But if indeed you or your sons turn away from following Me and do not keep the commandments and statutes I have set before you, and if you go off to serve and worship other gods, 
11009007	then I will cut off Israel from the land that I have given them, and I will banish from My presence this temple I have sanctified for My Name. Then Israel will become an object of scorn and ridicule among all peoples. 
11009008	And when this temple has become a heap of rubble, all who pass by it will be appalled and will hiss and say, ‘Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this temple?’ 
11009009	And others will answer, ‘Because they have forsaken the LORD their God who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them—because of this, the LORD has brought all this disaster upon them.’” 
11009010	Now at the end of the twenty years during which Solomon built these two houses, the house of the LORD and the royal palace, 
11009011	King Solomon gave twenty towns in the land of Galilee to Hiram king of Tyre, who had supplied him with cedar and cypress logs and gold for his every desire. 
11009012	So Hiram went out from Tyre to inspect the towns that Solomon had given him, but he was not pleased with them. 
11009013	“What are these towns you have given me, my brother?” asked Hiram, and he called them the Land of Cabul, as they are called to this day. 
11009014	And Hiram had sent the king 120 talents of gold. 
11009015	This is the account of the forced labor that King Solomon imposed to build the house of the LORD, his own palace, the supporting terraces, and the wall of Jerusalem, as well as Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. 
11009016	Pharaoh king of Egypt had attacked and captured Gezer. He had set it on fire, killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and given it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife. 
11009017	So Solomon rebuilt Gezer, Lower Beth-horon, 
11009018	Baalath, and Tamar in the Wilderness of Judah, 
11009019	as well as all the store cities that Solomon had for his chariots and horses —whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and throughout the land of his dominion. 
11009020	As for all the people who remained of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites (the people who were not Israelites)— 
11009021	their descendants who remained in the land, those whom the Israelites were unable to devote to destruction —Solomon conscripted these people to be forced laborers, as they are to this day. 
11009022	But Solomon did not consign any of the Israelites to slavery, because they were his men of war, his servants, his officers, his captains, and the commanders of his chariots and cavalry. 
11009023	They were also the chief officers over Solomon’s projects: 550 supervisors over the people who did the work. 
11009024	As soon as Pharaoh’s daughter had come up from the City of David to the palace that Solomon had built for her, he built the supporting terraces. 
11009025	Three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar he had built for the LORD, burning incense with them before the LORD. So he completed the temple. 
11009026	King Solomon also assembled a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth in Edom, on the shore of the Red Sea. 
11009027	And Hiram sent his servants, sailors who knew the sea, to serve in the fleet with Solomon’s servants. 
11009028	They sailed to Ophir and imported gold from there—420 talents —and delivered it to Solomon. 
11010001	Now when the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to test him with difficult questions. 
11010002	She arrived in Jerusalem with a very large caravan—with camels bearing spices, gold in great abundance, and precious stones. And she came to Solomon and spoke to him all that was on her mind. 
11010003	And Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too difficult for the king to explain. 
11010004	When the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, the palace he had built, 
11010005	the food at his table, the seating of his servants, the service and attire of his attendants, his cupbearers, and the burnt offerings he presented at the house of the LORD, it took her breath away. 
11010006	She said to the king, “The report I heard in my own country about your words and wisdom is true. 
11010007	But I did not believe these things until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half was told to me. Your wisdom and prosperity have far exceeded the report I heard. 
11010008	How blessed are your men! How blessed are these servants of yours who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom! 
11010009	Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you to set you on the throne of Israel. Because of the LORD’s eternal love for Israel, He has made you king to carry out justice and righteousness.” 
11010010	Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, a great quantity of spices, and precious stones. Never again were spices in such abundance brought in as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. 
11010011	(The fleet of Hiram that brought gold from Ophir also brought from Ophir a great cargo of almug wood and precious stones. 
11010012	The king made the almug wood into steps for the house of the LORD and for the king’s palace, and into lyres and harps for the singers. Never before had such almug wood been brought in, nor has such been seen again to this day.) 
11010013	King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired—whatever she asked—besides what he had given her out of his royal bounty. Then she left and returned to her own country, along with her servants. 
11010014	The weight of gold that came to Solomon each year was 666 talents, 
11010015	not including the revenue from the merchants, traders, and all the Arabian kings and governors of the land. 
11010016	King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of gold went into each shield. 
11010017	He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold; three minas of gold went into each shield. And the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon. 
11010018	Additionally, the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold. 
11010019	The throne had six steps, and its back had a rounded top. There were armrests on both sides of the seat, with a lion standing beside each armrest. 
11010020	Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like this had ever been made for any kingdom. 
11010021	All King Solomon’s drinking cups were gold, and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. There was no silver, because it was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon. 
11010022	For the king had the ships of Tarshish at sea with Hiram’s fleet, and once every three years the ships of Tarshish would arrive bearing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks. 
11010023	So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. 
11010024	The whole world sought an audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom that God had put in his heart. 
11010025	Year after year, each visitor would bring his tribute: articles of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules. 
11010026	Solomon accumulated 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses, which he stationed in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem. 
11010027	The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as abundant as sycamore in the foothills. 
11010028	Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and Kue; the royal merchants purchased them from Kue. 
11010029	A chariot could be imported from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. Likewise, they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of Aram. 
11011001	King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women along with the daughter of Pharaoh—women of Moab, Ammon, Edom, and Sidon, as well as Hittite women. 
11011002	These women were from the nations about which the LORD had told the Israelites, “You must not intermarry with them, for surely they will turn your hearts after their gods.” Yet Solomon clung to these women in love. 
11011003	He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines—and his wives turned his heart away. 
11011004	For when Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and he was not wholeheartedly devoted to the LORD his God, as his father David had been. 
11011005	Solomon followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians and Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. 
11011006	So Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD; unlike his father David, he did not follow the LORD completely. 
11011007	At that time on a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab and for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites. 
11011008	He did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods. 
11011009	Now the LORD grew angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice. 
11011010	Although He had warned Solomon explicitly not to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the LORD’s command. 
11011011	Then the LORD said to Solomon, “Because you have done this and have not kept My covenant and My statutes, which I have commanded you, I will tear the kingdom away from you and give it to your servant. 
11011012	Nevertheless, for the sake of your father David, I will not do it during your lifetime; I will tear it out of the hand of your son. 
11011013	Yet I will not tear the whole kingdom away from him. I will give one tribe to your son for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen.” 
11011014	Then the LORD raised up against Solomon an adversary, Hadad the Edomite, from the royal line of Edom. 
11011015	Earlier, when David was in Edom, Joab the commander of the army had gone to bury the dead and had struck down every male in Edom. 
11011016	Joab and all Israel had stayed there six months, until he had killed every male in Edom. 
11011017	But Hadad, still just a young boy, had fled to Egypt, along with some Edomites who were servants of his father. 
11011018	Hadad and his men set out from Midian and went to Paran. They took men from Paran with them and went to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house and land and provided him with food. 
11011019	There Hadad found such great favor in the sight of Pharaoh that he gave to him in marriage the sister of Queen Tahpenes, his own wife. 
11011020	And the sister of Tahpenes bore Hadad a son named Genubath. Tahpenes herself weaned him in Pharaoh’s palace, and Genubath lived there among the sons of Pharaoh. 
11011021	When Hadad heard in Egypt that David had rested with his fathers and that Joab, the commander of the army, was dead, he said to Pharaoh, “Let me go, that I may return to my own country.” 
11011022	But Pharaoh asked him, “What have you lacked here with me that you suddenly want to go back to your own country?” “Nothing,” Hadad replied, “but please let me go.” 
11011023	And God raised up against Solomon another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his master, Hadadezer king of Zobah, 
11011024	and had gathered men to himself. When David killed the Zobaites, Rezon captained a band of raiders and went to Damascus, where they settled and gained control. 
11011025	Rezon was Israel’s enemy throughout the days of Solomon, adding to the trouble caused by Hadad. So Rezon ruled over Aram with hostility toward Israel. 
11011026	Now Jeroboam son of Nebat was an Ephraimite from Zeredah whose mother was a widow named Zeruah. Jeroboam was a servant of Solomon, but he rebelled against the king, 
11011027	and this is the account of his rebellion against the king. Solomon had built the supporting terraces and repaired the gap in the wall of the city of his father David. 
11011028	Now Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor. So when Solomon noticed that the young man was industrious, he put him in charge of the whole labor force of the house of Joseph. 
11011029	During that time, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met Jeroboam on the road as he was going out of Jerusalem. Now Ahijah had wrapped himself in a new cloak, and the two of them were alone in the open field. 
11011030	And Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he was wearing, tore it into twelve pieces, 
11011031	and said to Jeroboam, “Take ten pieces for yourself, for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and I will give you ten tribes. 
11011032	But one tribe will remain for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel. 
11011033	For they have forsaken Me to worship Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites. They have not walked in My ways, nor done what is right in My eyes, nor kept My statutes and judgments, as Solomon’s father David did. 
11011034	Nevertheless, I will not take the whole kingdom out of Solomon’s hand, because I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of David My servant, whom I chose because he kept My commandments and statutes. 
11011035	But I will take ten tribes of the kingdom from the hand of his son and give them to you. 
11011036	I will give one tribe to his son, so that My servant David will always have a lamp before Me in Jerusalem, the city where I chose to put My Name. 
11011037	But as for you, I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your heart desires, and you will be king over Israel. 
11011038	If you listen to all that I command you, walk in My ways, and do what is right in My sight in order to keep My statutes and commandments as My servant David did, then I will be with you. I will build you a lasting dynasty just as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you. 
11011039	Because of this, I will humble David’s descendants—but not forever.’” 
11011040	Solomon therefore sought to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, where he remained until the death of Solomon. 
11011041	As for the rest of the acts of Solomon—all that he did, as well as his wisdom—are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon? 
11011042	Thus the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years. 
11011043	And Solomon rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David. And his son Rehoboam reigned in his place. 
11012001	Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone there to make him king. 
11012002	When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard about this, he was still in Egypt where he had fled from King Solomon and had been living ever since. 
11012003	So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and the whole assembly of Israel came to Rehoboam and said, 
11012004	“Your father put a heavy yoke on us. But now you must lighten the burden of your father’s service and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.” 
11012005	Rehoboam answered, “Go away for three days and then return to me.” So the people departed. 
11012006	Then King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. “How do you advise me to respond to these people?” he asked. 
11012007	They replied, “If you will be a servant to these people and serve them this day, and if you will respond by speaking kind words to them, they will be your servants forever.” 
11012008	But Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders; instead, he consulted the young men who had grown up with him and served him. 
11012009	He asked them, “What message do you advise that we send back to these people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us’?” 
11012010	The young men who had grown up with him replied, “This is how you should answer these people who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you must make it lighter.’ This is what you should tell them: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist! 
11012011	Whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. Whereas my father scourged you with whips, I will scourge you with scorpions.’” 
11012012	After three days, Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, since the king had said, “Come back to me on the third day.” 
11012013	And the king answered the people harshly. He rejected the advice of the elders 
11012014	and spoke to them as the young men had advised, saying, “Whereas my father made your yoke heavy, I will add to your yoke. Whereas my father scourged you with whips, I will scourge you with scorpions.” 
11012015	So the king did not listen to the people, and indeed this turn of events was from the LORD, to fulfill the word He had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite. 
11012016	When all Israel saw that the king had refused to listen to them, they answered the king: “What portion do we have in David, and what inheritance in the son of Jesse? To your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, O David!” So the Israelites went home, 
11012017	but Rehoboam still reigned over the Israelites living in the cities of Judah. 
11012018	Then King Rehoboam sent out Adoram, who was in charge of the forced labor, but all Israel stoned him to death. And King Rehoboam mounted his chariot in haste and escaped to Jerusalem. 
11012019	So to this day Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David. 
11012020	When all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they summoned him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. Only the tribe of Judah followed the house of David. 
11012021	And when Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mobilized the whole house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin—180,000 chosen warriors—to fight against the house of Israel and restore the kingdom to Rehoboam son of Solomon. 
11012022	But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God: 
11012023	“Tell Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah, all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and the rest of the people 
11012024	that this is what the LORD says: ‘You are not to go up and fight against your brothers, the Israelites. Each of you must return home, for this is My doing.’” So they listened to the word of the LORD and turned back according to the word of the LORD. 
11012025	Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. And from there he went out and built Penuel. 
11012026	Jeroboam said in his heart, “Now the kingdom might revert to the house of David. 
11012027	If these people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, their hearts will return to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah; then they will kill me and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.” 
11012028	After seeking advice, the king made two golden calves and said to the people, “Going up to Jerusalem is too much for you. Here, O Israel, are your gods, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.” 
11012029	One calf he set up in Bethel, and the other in Dan. 
11012030	And this thing became a sin; the people walked as far as Dan to worship before one of the calves. 
11012031	Jeroboam also built shrines on the high places and appointed from every class of people priests who were not Levites. 
11012032	And Jeroboam ordained a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the feast that was in Judah, and he offered sacrifices on the altar; he made this offering in Bethel to sacrifice to the calves he had set up, and he installed priests in Bethel for the high places he had set up. 
11012033	On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, a month of his own choosing, Jeroboam offered sacrifices on the altar he had set up in Bethel. So he ordained a feast for the Israelites, offered sacrifices on the altar, and burned incense. 
11013001	Suddenly, as Jeroboam was standing beside the altar to burn incense, there came a man of God from Judah to Bethel by the word of the LORD. 
11013002	And he cried out against the altar by the word of the LORD, “O altar, O altar, this is what the LORD says: ‘A son named Josiah will be born to the house of David, and upon you he will sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense upon you, and human bones will be burned upon you.’” 
11013003	That day the man of God gave a sign, saying, “The LORD has spoken this sign: ‘Surely the altar will be split apart, and the ashes upon it will be poured out.’” 
11013004	Now when King Jeroboam, who was at the altar in Bethel, heard the word that the man of God had cried out against it, he stretched out his hand and said, “Seize him!” But the hand he stretched out toward him withered, so that he could not pull it back. 
11013005	And the altar was split apart, and the ashes poured out, according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of the LORD. 
11013006	Then the king responded to the man of God, “Intercede with the LORD your God and pray for me that my hand may be restored.” So the man of God interceded with the LORD, and the king’s hand was restored to him as it was before. 
11013007	Then the king said to the man of God, “Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.” 
11013008	But the man of God replied, “If you were to give me half your possessions, I still would not go with you, nor would I eat bread or drink water in this place. 
11013009	For this is what I was commanded by the word of the LORD: ‘You must not eat bread or drink water or return by the way you came.’” 
11013010	So the man of God went another way and did not return by the way he had come to Bethel. 
11013011	Now a certain old prophet was living in Bethel, and his sons came and told him all the deeds that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. They also told their father the words that the man had spoken to the king. 
11013012	“Which way did he go?” their father asked. And his sons showed him the way taken by the man of God, who had come from Judah. 
11013013	So the prophet said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” Then they saddled the donkey for him, and he mounted it 
11013014	and went after the man of God. He found him sitting under an oak tree and asked, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?” “I am,” he replied. 
11013015	So the prophet said to the man of God, “Come home with me and eat some bread.” 
11013016	But the man replied, “I cannot go home with you, and I will not eat bread or drink water with you in this place. 
11013017	For I have been told by the word of the LORD: ‘You must not eat bread or drink water there or return by the way you came.’” 
11013018	Then the prophet replied, “I too am a prophet like you, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, ‘Bring him back with you to your house, so that he may eat bread and drink water.’” The old prophet was lying to him, 
11013019	but the man of God went back with him, ate bread in his house, and drank water. 
11013020	While they were sitting at the table, the word of the LORD came to the prophet who had brought him back, 
11013021	and the prophet cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Because you have defied the word of the LORD and have not kept the commandment that the LORD your God gave you, 
11013022	but you went back and ate bread and drank water in the place where He told you not to do so, your body shall never reach the tomb of your fathers.’” 
11013023	And after the man of God had finished eating and drinking, the old prophet who had brought him back saddled the donkey for him. 
11013024	As he went on his way, a lion met him on the road and killed him, and his body was left lying in the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside it. 
11013025	And there were men passing by who saw the body lying in the road with the lion standing beside it, and they went and reported this in the city where the old prophet lived. 
11013026	When the prophet who had brought him back from his journey heard this, he said, “It is the man of God who disobeyed the command of the LORD. Therefore the LORD has delivered him to the lion, and it has mauled him and killed him, according to the word that the LORD had spoken to him.” 
11013027	Then the old prophet instructed his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled it, 
11013028	and he went and found the body lying in the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside it. The lion had not eaten the body or mauled the donkey. 
11013029	So the old prophet lifted up the body of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back to his own city to mourn for him and bury him. 
11013030	Then he laid the body in his own tomb, and they lamented over him, “Oh, my brother!” 
11013031	After he had buried him, the prophet said to his sons, “When I die, you must bury me in the tomb where the man of God is buried. Lay my bones beside his bones, 
11013032	for the message that he cried out by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel and against all the shrines on the high places in the cities of Samaria will surely come to pass.” 
11013033	Even after these events, Jeroboam did not repent of his evil ways, but again he appointed priests for the high places from every class of people. He ordained anyone who desired to be a priest of the high places. 
11013034	And this was the sin of the house of Jeroboam that led to its extermination and destruction from the face of the earth. 
11014001	At that time Abijah son of Jeroboam became ill, 
11014002	and Jeroboam said to his wife, “Now get up, disguise yourself so they will not recognize you as my wife, and go to Shiloh. For Ahijah the prophet is there; it was he who spoke about my kingship over this people. 
11014003	Take with you ten loaves of bread, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will become of the boy.” 
11014004	Jeroboam’s wife did as instructed; she arose and went to Shiloh and arrived at Ahijah’s house. Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were dim because of his age. 
11014005	But the LORD had said to Ahijah, “Behold, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to ask you about her son, for he is ill. You are to say such and such to her, because when she arrives, she will be disguised.” 
11014006	So when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet entering the door, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam! Why are you disguised? For I have been sent to you with bad news. 
11014007	Go, tell Jeroboam that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘I raised you up from among the people and appointed you ruler over My people Israel. 
11014008	I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you. But you have not been like My servant David, who kept My commandments and followed Me with all his heart, doing only what was right in My eyes. 
11014009	You have done more evil than all who came before you. You have proceeded to make for yourself other gods and molten images to provoke Me, and you have flung Me behind your back. 
11014010	Because of all this, behold, I am bringing disaster on the house of Jeroboam: I will cut off from Jeroboam every male, both slave and free, in Israel; I will burn up the house of Jeroboam as one burns up dung until it is gone! 
11014011	Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city will be eaten by dogs, and anyone who dies in the field will be eaten by the birds of the air.’ For the LORD has spoken. 
11014012	As for you, get up and go home. When your feet enter the city, the child will die. 
11014013	All Israel will mourn for him and bury him. For this is the only one belonging to Jeroboam who will receive a proper burial, because only in him has the LORD, the God of Israel, found any good in the house of Jeroboam. 
11014014	Moreover, the LORD will raise up for Himself a king over Israel who will cut off the house of Jeroboam. This is the day—yes, even today! 
11014015	For the LORD will strike Israel as a reed is shaken in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land that He gave their fathers, and He will scatter them beyond the Euphrates, because they have made their Asherah poles, provoking the LORD to anger. 
11014016	So He will give Israel over on account of the sins Jeroboam has committed and has caused Israel to commit.” 
11014017	Then Jeroboam’s wife got up and departed for Tirzah, and as soon as she stepped over the threshold of the house, the boy died. 
11014018	And they buried him, and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word that the LORD had spoken through His servant Ahijah the prophet. 
11014019	As for the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he waged war and how he reigned, they are indeed written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 
11014020	And the length of Jeroboam’s reign was twenty-two years, and he rested with his fathers, and his son Nadab reigned in his place. 
11014021	Meanwhile, Rehoboam son of Solomon reigned in Judah. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the LORD had chosen from all the tribes of Israel in which to put His Name. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite. 
11014022	And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and by the sins they committed they provoked Him to jealous anger more than all their fathers had done. 
11014023	They also built for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree. 
11014024	There were even male shrine prostitutes in the land. They imitated all the abominations of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites. 
11014025	In the fifth year of Rehoboam’s reign, Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem. 
11014026	He seized the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the royal palace. He took everything, including all the gold shields that Solomon had made. 
11014027	Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place and committed them to the care of the captains of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace. 
11014028	And whenever the king entered the house of the LORD, the guards would bear the shields, and later they would return them to the guardroom. 
11014029	As for the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, along with all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
11014030	There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout their days. 
11014031	And Rehoboam rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David; his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite. And his son Abijam reigned in his place. 
11015001	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam son of Nebat, Abijam became king of Judah, 
11015002	and he reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother’s name was Maacah daughter of Abishalom. 
11015003	And Abijam walked in all the sins that his father before him had committed, and his heart was not as fully devoted to the LORD his God as the heart of David his forefather had been. 
11015004	Nevertheless, for the sake of David, the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem by raising up a son to succeed him and to make Jerusalem strong. 
11015005	For David had done what was right in the eyes of the LORD and had not turned aside from anything the LORD commanded all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. 
11015006	And there was war between the houses of Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of Abijam’s life. 
11015007	As for the rest of the acts of Abijam, along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. 
11015008	And Abijam rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David, and his son Asa reigned in his place. 
11015009	In the twentieth year of Jeroboam’s reign over Israel, Asa became king of Judah, 
11015010	and he reigned in Jerusalem forty-one years. His grandmother’s name was Maacah daughter of Abishalom. 
11015011	And Asa did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, as his father David had done. 
11015012	He banished the male shrine prostitutes from the land and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. 
11015013	He also removed his grandmother Maacah from her position as queen mother because she had made a detestable Asherah pole. Asa chopped down the pole and burned it in the Kidron Valley. 
11015014	The high places were not removed, but Asa’s heart was fully devoted to the LORD all his days. 
11015015	And he brought into the house of the LORD the silver and gold and the articles that he and his father had dedicated. 
11015016	Now there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their days. 
11015017	Baasha king of Israel went to war against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah. 
11015018	So Asa withdrew all the silver and gold that remained in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and the royal palace. He entrusted it to his servants and sent them with this message to Ben-hadad son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, the king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus: 
11015019	“Let there be a treaty between me and you as there was between my father and your father. See, I have sent you a gift of silver and gold. Now go and break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.” 
11015020	And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, conquering Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and the whole land of Naphtali, including the region of Chinnereth. 
11015021	When Baasha learned of this, he stopped fortifying Ramah and withdrew to Tirzah. 
11015022	Then King Asa summoned all the men of Judah, with no exceptions, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and the timbers Baasha had used for building. And with these materials King Asa built up Geba of Benjamin, as well as Mizpah. 
11015023	Now the rest of the acts of Asa, along with all his might, all his accomplishments, and the cities he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? In his old age, however, he became diseased in his feet. 
11015024	And Asa rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of his father David, and his son Jehoshaphat reigned in his place. 
11015025	In the second year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Nadab son of Jeroboam became king of Israel, and he reigned two years. 
11015026	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of his father and in his sin, which he had caused Israel to commit. 
11015027	Then Baasha son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar conspired against Nadab, and Baasha struck him down at Gibbethon of the Philistines while Nadab and all Israel were besieging the city. 
11015028	In the third year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Baasha killed Nadab and reigned in his place. 
11015029	As soon as Baasha became king, he struck down the entire household of Jeroboam. He did not leave to Jeroboam anyone who breathed, but destroyed them all according to the word that the LORD had spoken through His servant Ahijah the Shilonite, 
11015030	because of the sins Jeroboam had committed and had caused Israel to commit, and because he had provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger. 
11015031	As for the rest of the acts of Nadab, along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
11015032	And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their days. 
11015033	In the third year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Baasha son of Ahijah became king of all Israel, and he reigned in Tirzah twenty-four years. 
11015034	And Baasha did evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin, which he had caused Israel to commit. 
11016001	Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu son of Hanani against Baasha, saying: 
11016002	“Even though I lifted you out of the dust and made you ruler over My people Israel, you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and have caused My people Israel to sin and to provoke Me to anger by their sins. 
11016003	So now I will consume Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat: 
11016004	Anyone belonging to Baasha who dies in the city will be eaten by dogs, and anyone who dies in the field will be eaten by the birds of the air.” 
11016005	As for the rest of the acts of Baasha, along with his accomplishments and might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
11016006	And Baasha rested with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah, and his son Elah reigned in his place. 
11016007	Moreover, the word of the LORD came through the prophet Jehu son of Hanani against Baasha and his house, because of all the evil he had done in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands and becoming like the house of Jeroboam, and also because Baasha had struck down the house of Jeroboam. 
11016008	In the twenty-sixth year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Elah son of Baasha became king of Israel, and he reigned in Tirzah two years. 
11016009	However, while Elah was in Tirzah getting drunk in the house of Arza the steward of his household there, Elah’s servant Zimri, the commander of half his chariots, conspired against him. 
11016010	So in the twenty-seventh year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Zimri went in, struck Elah down, and killed him. And Zimri reigned in his place. 
11016011	As soon as Zimri began to reign and was seated on the throne, he struck down the entire household of Baasha. He did not leave a single male, whether a kinsman or friend. 
11016012	So Zimri destroyed the entire household of Baasha, according to the word that the LORD had spoken against Baasha through Jehu the prophet. 
11016013	This happened because of all the sins Baasha and his son Elah had committed and had caused Israel to commit, provoking the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger with their worthless idols. 
11016014	As for the rest of the acts of Elah, along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
11016015	In the twenty-seventh year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Zimri reigned in Tirzah for seven days. Now the troops were encamped against Gibbethon of the Philistines, 
11016016	and the people in the camp heard that Zimri had conspired against the king and struck him down. So there in the camp that very day, all Israel proclaimed Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel. 
11016017	Then Omri and all the Israelites marched up from Gibbethon and besieged Tirzah. 
11016018	When Zimri saw that the city was captured, he entered the citadel of the royal palace and burned it down upon himself. So he died 
11016019	because of the sins he had committed, doing evil in the sight of the LORD and following the example of Jeroboam and the sin he had committed and had caused Israel to commit. 
11016020	As for the rest of the acts of Zimri and the treason he committed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
11016021	At that time the people of Israel were divided: Half of the people supported Tibni son of Ginath as king, and half supported Omri. 
11016022	But the followers of Omri proved stronger than those of Tibni son of Ginath. So Tibni died and Omri became king. 
11016023	In the thirty-first year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Omri became king of Israel, and he reigned twelve years, six of them in Tirzah. 
11016024	He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver and built a city there, calling it Samaria after the name of Shemer, who had owned the hill. 
11016025	But Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD and acted more wickedly than all who were before him. 
11016026	For he walked in all the ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat and in his sins, which he caused Israel to commit, provoking the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger with their worthless idols. 
11016027	As for the rest of the acts of Omri, along with his accomplishments and the might he exercised, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
11016028	And Omri rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria, and his son Ahab reigned in his place. 
11016029	In the thirty-eighth year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Ahab son of Omri became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria twenty-two years. 
11016030	However, Ahab son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD, more than all who were before him. 
11016031	And as if it were not enough for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, he even married Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and he then proceeded to serve and worship Baal. 
11016032	First, Ahab set up an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal that he had built in Samaria. 
11016033	Then he set up an Asherah pole. Thus Ahab did more to provoke the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel before him. 
11016034	In Ahab’s days, Hiel the Bethelite rebuilt Jericho. At the cost of Abiram his firstborn he laid its foundation, and at the cost of Segub his youngest he set up its gates, according to the word that the LORD had spoken through Joshua son of Nun. 
11017001	Now Elijah the Tishbite, who was among the settlers of Gilead, said to Ahab, “As surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, before whom I stand, there will be neither dew nor rain in these years except at my word!” 
11017002	Then a revelation from the LORD came to Elijah: 
11017003	“Leave here, turn eastward, and hide yourself by the Brook of Cherith, east of the Jordan. 
11017004	And you are to drink from the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.” 
11017005	So Elijah did what the LORD had told him, and he went and lived by the Brook of Cherith, east of the Jordan. 
11017006	The ravens would bring him bread and meat in the morning and evening, and he would drink from the brook. 
11017007	Some time later, however, the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land. 
11017008	Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah: 
11017009	“Get up and go to Zarephath of Sidon, and stay there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to provide for you.” 
11017010	So Elijah got up and went to Zarephath. When he arrived at the city gate, there was a widow gathering sticks. Elijah called to her and said, “Please bring me a little water in a cup, so that I may drink.” 
11017011	And as she was going to get it, he called to her and said, “Please bring me a piece of bread.” 
11017012	But she replied, “As surely as the LORD your God lives, I have no bread—only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. Look, I am gathering a couple of sticks to take home and prepare a meal for myself and my son, so that we may eat it and die.” 
11017013	“Do not be afraid,” Elijah said to her. “Go and do as you have said. But first make me a small cake of bread from what you have, and bring it out to me. Afterward, make some for yourself and your son, 
11017014	for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘The jar of flour will not be exhausted and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the LORD sends rain upon the face of the earth.’” 
11017015	So she went and did according to the word of Elijah, and there was food every day for Elijah and the woman and her household. 
11017016	The jar of flour was not exhausted and the jug of oil did not run dry, according to the word that the LORD had spoken through Elijah. 
11017017	Later, the son of the woman who owned the house became ill, and his sickness grew worse and worse, until no breath remained in him. 
11017018	“O man of God,” said the woman to Elijah, “what have you done to me? Have you come to remind me of my iniquity and cause the death of my son?” 
11017019	But Elijah said to her, “Give me your son.” So he took him from her arms, carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his own bed. 
11017020	Then he cried out to the LORD, “O LORD my God, have You also brought tragedy on this widow who has opened her home to me, by causing her son to die?” 
11017021	Then he stretched himself out over the child three times and cried out to the LORD, “O LORD my God, please let this boy’s life return to him!” 
11017022	And the LORD listened to the voice of Elijah, and the child’s life returned to him, and he lived. 
11017023	Then Elijah took the child, brought him down from the upper room into the house, and gave him to his mother. “Look, your son is alive,” Elijah declared. 
11017024	Then the woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the LORD from your mouth is truth.” 
11018001	After a long time, in the third year of the drought, the word of the LORD came to Elijah: “Go and present yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain upon the face of the earth.” 
11018002	So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. The famine was severe in Samaria, 
11018003	and Ahab summoned Obadiah, who was in charge of the palace. (Now Obadiah greatly feared the LORD, 
11018004	for when Jezebel had slaughtered the prophets of the LORD, Obadiah had taken a hundred prophets and hidden them, fifty men per cave, providing them with food and water.) 
11018005	Then Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go throughout the land to every spring and every valley. Perhaps we will find grass to keep the horses and mules alive so that we will not have to destroy any livestock.” 
11018006	So they divided the land to explore. Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went the other way by himself. 
11018007	Now as Obadiah went on his way, Elijah suddenly met him. When Obadiah recognized him, he fell facedown and said, “Is it you, my lord Elijah?” 
11018008	“It is I,” he answered. “Go tell your master, ‘Elijah is here!’” 
11018009	But Obadiah replied, “How have I sinned, that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to put me to death? 
11018010	As surely as the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent someone to search for you. When they said, ‘He is not here,’ he made that kingdom or nation swear that they had not found you. 
11018011	And now you say, ‘Go tell your master that Elijah is here!’ 
11018012	I do not know where the Spirit of the LORD may carry you off when I leave you. Then when I go and tell Ahab and he does not find you, he will kill me. But I, your servant, have feared the LORD from my youth. 
11018013	Was it not reported to my lord what I did when Jezebel slaughtered the prophets of the LORD? I hid a hundred prophets of the LORD, fifty men per cave, and I provided them with food and water. 
11018014	And now you say, ‘Go tell your lord that Elijah is here!’ He will kill me!” 
11018015	Then Elijah said, “As surely as the LORD of Hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will present myself to Ahab today.” 
11018016	So Obadiah went to inform Ahab, who went to meet Elijah. 
11018017	When Ahab saw Elijah, he said to him, “Is that you, O troubler of Israel?” 
11018018	“I have not troubled Israel,” Elijah replied, “but you and your father’s house have, for you have forsaken the commandments of the LORD and have followed the Baals. 
11018019	Now summon all Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel, along with the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah who eat at Jezebel’s table.” 
11018020	So Ahab summoned all the Israelites and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel. 
11018021	Then Elijah approached all the people and said, “How long will you waver between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow Him. But if Baal is God, follow him.” But the people did not answer a word. 
11018022	Then Elijah said to the people, “I am the only remaining prophet of the LORD, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets. 
11018023	Get two bulls for us. Let the prophets of Baal choose one bull for themselves, cut it into pieces, and place it on the wood but not light the fire. And I will prepare the other bull and place it on the wood but not light the fire. 
11018024	Then you may call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD. The God who answers by fire, He is God.” And all the people answered, “What you say is good.” 
11018025	Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Since you are so numerous, choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first. Then call on the name of your god, but do not light the fire.” 
11018026	And they took the bull that was given them, prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon, shouting, “O Baal, answer us!” But there was no sound, and no one answered as they leaped around the altar they had made. 
11018027	At noon Elijah began to taunt them, saying, “Shout louder, for he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or occupied, or on a journey. Perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened!” 
11018028	So they shouted louder and cut themselves with knives and lances, as was their custom, until the blood gushed over them. 
11018029	Midday passed, and they kept on raving until the time of the evening sacrifice. But there was no response; no one answered, no one paid attention. 
11018030	Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me.” So all the people approached him, and he repaired the altar of the LORD that had been torn down. 
11018031	And Elijah took twelve stones, one for each tribe of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come and said, “Israel shall be your name.” 
11018032	And with the stones, Elijah built an altar in the name of the LORD. Then he dug a trench around the altar large enough to hold two seahs of seed. 
11018033	Next, he arranged the wood, cut up the bull, placed it on the wood, 
11018034	and said, “Fill four waterpots and pour the water on the offering and on the wood.” “Do it a second time,” he said, and they did it a second time. “Do it a third time,” he said, and they did it a third time. 
11018035	So the water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench. 
11018036	At the time of the evening sacrifice, Elijah the prophet approached the altar and said, “O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that You are God in Israel and that I am Your servant and have done all these things at Your command. 
11018037	Answer me, O LORD! Answer me, so that this people will know that You, the LORD, are God, and that You have turned their hearts back again.” 
11018038	Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the sacrifice, the wood, the stones, and the dust, and it licked up the water in the trench. 
11018039	When all the people saw this, they fell facedown and said, “The LORD, He is God! The LORD, He is God!” 
11018040	Then Elijah ordered them, “Seize the prophets of Baal! Do not let a single one escape.” So they seized them, and Elijah brought them down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered them there. 
11018041	And Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy rain.” 
11018042	So Ahab went up to eat and drink. But Elijah climbed to the summit of Carmel, bent down on the ground, and put his face between his knees. 
11018043	“Go and look toward the sea,” he said to his servant. So the servant went and looked, and he said, “There is nothing there.” Seven times Elijah said, “Go back.” 
11018044	On the seventh time the servant reported, “There is a cloud as small as a man’s hand rising from the sea.” And Elijah replied, “Go and tell Ahab, ‘Prepare your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.’” 
11018045	Meanwhile, the sky grew dark with clouds and wind, and a heavy rain began to fall. So Ahab rode away and went to Jezreel. 
11018046	And the hand of the LORD came upon Elijah, and he tucked his cloak into his belt and ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel. 
11019001	Now Ahab told Jezebel everything that Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. 
11019002	So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “May the gods deal with me, and ever so severely, if by this time tomorrow I have not made your life like the lives of those you killed!” 
11019003	And Elijah was afraid and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there, 
11019004	while he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness. He sat down under a broom tree and prayed that he might die. “I have had enough, LORD,” he said. “Take my life, for I am no better than my fathers.” 
11019005	Then he lay down under the broom tree and fell asleep. Suddenly an angel touched him and said, “Get up and eat.” 
11019006	And he looked around, and there by his head was a cake of bread baked over hot coals, and a jar of water. So he ate and drank and lay down again. 
11019007	A second time the angel of the LORD returned and touched him, saying, “Get up and eat, or the journey will be too much for you.” 
11019008	So he got up and ate and drank. And strengthened by that food, he walked forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God. 
11019009	There Elijah entered a cave and spent the night. And the word of the LORD came to him, saying, “What are you doing here, Elijah?” 
11019010	“I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of Hosts,” he replied, “but the Israelites have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I am the only one left, and they are seeking my life as well.” 
11019011	Then the LORD said, “Go out and stand on the mountain before the LORD. Behold, the LORD is about to pass by.” And a great and mighty wind tore into the mountains and shattered the rocks before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake. 
11019012	After the earthquake there was a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire came a still, small voice. 
11019013	When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave. Suddenly a voice came to him and said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?” 
11019014	“I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of Hosts,” he replied, “but the Israelites have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I am the only one left, and they are seeking my life as well.” 
11019015	Then the LORD said to him, “Go back by the way you came, and go to the Desert of Damascus. When you arrive, you are to anoint Hazael as king over Aram. 
11019016	You are also to anoint Jehu son of Nimshi as king over Israel and Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel-meholah to succeed you as prophet. 
11019017	Then Jehu will put to death whoever escapes the sword of Hazael, and Elisha will put to death whoever escapes the sword of Jehu. 
11019018	Nevertheless, I have reserved seven thousand in Israel—all whose knees have not bowed to Baal and whose mouths have not kissed him.” 
11019019	So Elijah departed and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve teams of oxen, and he was with the twelfth team. Elijah passed by him and threw his cloak around him. 
11019020	So Elisha left the oxen, ran after Elijah, and said, “Please let me kiss my father and mother goodbye, and then I will follow you.” “Go on back,” Elijah replied, “for what have I done to you?” 
11019021	So Elisha turned back from him, took his pair of oxen, and slaughtered them. Using the oxen’s equipment for fuel, he cooked the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow and serve Elijah. 
11020001	Now Ben-hadad king of Aram assembled his entire army. Accompanied by thirty-two kings with their horses and chariots, he marched up, besieged Samaria, and waged war against it. 
11020002	Then he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel, 
11020003	saying, “This is what Ben-hadad says: ‘Your silver and gold are mine, and your best wives and children are mine!’” 
11020004	And the king of Israel replied, “Just as you say, my lord the king: I am yours, along with all that I have.” 
11020005	The messengers came back and said, “This is what Ben-hadad says: ‘I have sent to you to demand your silver, your gold, your wives, and your children. 
11020006	But about this time tomorrow I will send my servants to search your palace and the houses of your servants. They will seize and carry away all that is precious to you.’” 
11020007	Then the king of Israel summoned all the elders of the land and said, “Please take note and see that this man is looking for trouble, for when he demanded my wives, my children, my silver, and my gold, I did not deny him.” 
11020008	And the elders and the people all said, “Do not listen to him or consent to his terms.” 
11020009	So Ahab answered the messengers of Ben-hadad, “Tell my lord the king, ‘All that you demanded of your servant the first time I will do, but this thing I cannot do.’” So the messengers departed and relayed the message to Ben-hadad. 
11020010	Then Ben-hadad sent another message to Ahab: “May the gods deal with me, and ever so severely, if enough dust remains of Samaria for each of my men to have a handful.” 
11020011	And the king of Israel replied, “Tell him: ‘The one putting on his armor should not boast like one taking it off.’” 
11020012	Ben-hadad received this message while he and the kings were drinking in their tents, and he said to his servants, “Take your positions.” So they stationed themselves against the city. 
11020013	Meanwhile a prophet approached Ahab king of Israel and declared, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Do you see this entire great army? Behold, I will deliver it into your hand this very day, and you will know that I am the LORD.’” 
11020014	“By whom?” Ahab asked. And the prophet replied, “This is what the LORD says: ‘By the young officers of the district governors.’” “Who will start the battle?” asked Ahab. “You will,” answered the prophet. 
11020015	So Ahab assembled the young officers of the district governors, and there were 232 men. And after them, he assembled the rest of the Israelite troops, 7,000 in all. 
11020016	They marched out at noon while Ben-hadad and the 32 kings allied with him were in their tents getting drunk. 
11020017	And the young officers of the district governors marched out first. Now Ben-hadad had sent out scouts, who reported to him, “Men are marching out of Samaria.” 
11020018	“If they have marched out in peace,” he said, “take them alive. Even if they have marched out for war, take them alive.” 
11020019	Meanwhile, these young officers of the district governors marched out of the city, with the army behind them, 
11020020	and each one struck down his opponent. So the Arameans fled, with the Israelites in pursuit. But Ben-hadad king of Aram escaped on horseback with the cavalry. 
11020021	Then the king of Israel marched out and attacked the horses and chariots, inflicting a great slaughter on the Arameans. 
11020022	Afterward, the prophet approached the king of Israel and said, “Go and strengthen your position, and take note what you must do, for in the spring the king of Aram will come up against you.” 
11020023	Meanwhile, the servants of the king of Aram said to him, “Their gods are gods of the hills. That is why they prevailed over us. Instead, we should fight them on the plains; surely then we will prevail. 
11020024	So do this: Dismiss all the kings from their positions and replace them with other officers. 
11020025	And you must raise an army like the one you have lost—horse for horse and chariot for chariot—so we can fight the Israelites on the plain, where we will surely prevail.” And the king approved their plan and acted accordingly. 
11020026	In the spring, Ben-hadad mobilized the Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel. 
11020027	The Israelites also mobilized, gathered supplies, and marched out to meet them. The Israelites camped before them like two small flocks of goats, while the Arameans covered the countryside. 
11020028	Then the man of God approached the king of Israel and said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Because the Arameans have said that the LORD is a god of the hills and not of the valleys, I will deliver all this great army into your hand. Then you will know that I am the LORD.’” 
11020029	For seven days the armies camped opposite each other, and on the seventh day the battle ensued, and the Israelites struck down the Arameans—a hundred thousand foot soldiers in one day. 
11020030	The rest of them fled into the city of Aphek, where the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand of the remaining men. Ben-hadad also fled to the city and hid in an inner room. 
11020031	Then the servants of Ben-hadad said to him, “Look now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful. Let us go out to the king of Israel with sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our heads. Perhaps he will spare your life.” 
11020032	So with sackcloth around their waists and ropes around their heads, they went to the king of Israel and said, “Your servant Ben-hadad says, ‘Please spare my life.’” And the king answered, “Is he still alive? He is my brother.” 
11020033	Now the men were looking for a sign of hope, and they quickly grasped at this word and replied, “Yes, your brother Ben-hadad.” “Go and get him!” said the king. Then Ben-hadad came out, and Ahab had him come up into his chariot. 
11020034	Ben-hadad said to him, “I will restore the cities my father took from your father; you may set up your own marketplaces in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.” “By this treaty I release you,” Ahab replied. So he made a treaty with him and sent him away. 
11020035	Meanwhile, by the word of the LORD, one of the sons of the prophets said to his companion, “Strike me, please!” But the man refused to strike him. 
11020036	Then the prophet said to him, “Because you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, as soon as you depart from me a lion will kill you.” And when he left, a lion found him and killed him. 
11020037	Then the prophet found another man and said, “Strike me, please!” So the man struck him and wounded him, 
11020038	and the prophet went and waited on the road for the king, disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes. 
11020039	As the king passed by, he cried out to the king: “Your servant had marched out into the middle of the battle, when suddenly a man came over with a captive and told me, ‘Guard this man! If he goes missing for any reason, your life will be exchanged for his life, or you will weigh out a talent of silver.’ 
11020040	But while your servant was busy here and there, the man disappeared.” And the king of Israel said to him, “So shall your judgment be; you have pronounced it on yourself.” 
11020041	Then the prophet quickly removed the bandage from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets. 
11020042	And the prophet said to the king, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Because you have let slip from your hand the man I had devoted to destruction, your life will be exchanged for his life, and your people for his people.’” 
11020043	Sullen and angry, the king of Israel went home to Samaria. 
11021001	Some time after these events, Naboth the Jezreelite owned a vineyard in Jezreel next to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. 
11021002	So Ahab said to Naboth, “Give me your vineyard to use as a vegetable garden, since it is next to my palace. I will give you a better vineyard in its place—or if you prefer, I will give you its value in silver.” 
11021003	But Naboth replied, “The LORD forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers.” 
11021004	So Ahab went to his palace, sullen and angry because Naboth the Jezreelite had told him, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” He lay down on his bed, turned his face away, and refused to eat. 
11021005	Soon his wife Jezebel came in and asked, “Why are you so sullen that you refuse to eat?” 
11021006	Ahab answered, “Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and told him, ‘Give me your vineyard for silver, or if you wish, I will give you another vineyard in its place.’ And he replied, ‘I will not give you my vineyard!’” 
11021007	But his wife Jezebel said to him, “Do you not reign over Israel? Get up, eat some food, and be cheerful, for I will get you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.” 
11021008	Then Jezebel wrote letters in Ahab’s name, sealed them with his seal, and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived with Naboth in his city. 
11021009	In the letters she wrote: “Proclaim a fast and give Naboth a seat of honor among the people. 
11021010	But seat two scoundrels opposite him and have them testify, ‘You have cursed both God and the king!’ Then take him out and stone him to death.” 
11021011	So the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth’s city did as Jezebel had instructed in the letters she had written to them. 
11021012	They proclaimed a fast and gave Naboth a seat of honor among the people. 
11021013	And the two scoundrels came in and sat opposite Naboth, and these men testified against him before the people, saying, “Naboth has cursed both God and the king!” So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death. 
11021014	Then they sent word to Jezebel: “Naboth has been stoned to death.” 
11021015	When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she said to Ahab, “Get up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, who refused to give it to you for silver. For Naboth is no longer alive, but dead.” 
11021016	And when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up and went down to take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite. 
11021017	Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 
11021018	“Get up and go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria. See, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession of it. 
11021019	Tell him that this is what the LORD says: ‘Have you not murdered a man and seized his land?’ Then tell him that this is also what the LORD says: ‘In the place where the dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, there also the dogs will lick up your blood—yes, yours!’” 
11021020	When Elijah arrived, Ahab said to him, “So you have found me out, my enemy.” He replied, “I have found you out because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the LORD. 
11021021	This is what the LORD says: ‘I will bring calamity on you and consume your descendants; I will cut off from Ahab every male in Israel, both slave and free. 
11021022	I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like that of Baasha son of Ahijah, because you have provoked My anger and caused Israel to sin.’ 
11021023	And the LORD also speaks concerning Jezebel: ‘The dogs will devour Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.’ 
11021024	Anyone belonging to Ahab who dies in the city will be eaten by dogs, and anyone who dies in the field will be eaten by the birds of the air.” 
11021025	(Surely there was never one like Ahab, who sold himself to do evil in the sight of the LORD, incited by his wife Jezebel. 
11021026	He committed the most detestable acts by going after idols, just like the Amorites whom the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.) 
11021027	When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and fasted. He lay down in sackcloth and walked around meekly. 
11021028	Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying: 
11021029	“Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before Me? Because he has humbled himself before Me, I will not bring the calamity during his days, but I will bring it upon his house in the days of his son.” 
11022001	Then three years passed without war between Aram and Israel. 
11022002	However, in the third year, Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to visit the king of Israel, 
11022003	who said to his servants, “Do you not know that Ramoth-gilead is ours, but we have failed to take it from the hand of the king of Aram?” 
11022004	So he asked Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to fight against Ramoth-gilead?” Jehoshaphat answered the king of Israel, “I am as you are, my people are your people, and my horses are your horses.” 
11022005	But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire first for the word of the LORD.” 
11022006	So the king of Israel assembled the prophets, about four hundred men, and asked them, “Should I go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I refrain?” “Go up,” they replied, “and the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.” 
11022007	But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there not still a prophet of the LORD here of whom we can inquire?” 
11022008	The king of Israel answered, “There is still one man through whom we can inquire of the LORD, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good for me, but only bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah.” “The king should not say that!” Jehoshaphat replied. 
11022009	So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, “Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once.” 
11022010	Dressed in royal attire, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them. 
11022011	Now Zedekiah son of Chenaanah had made for himself iron horns and declared, “This is what the LORD says: ‘With these you shall gore the Arameans until they are finished off.’” 
11022012	And all the prophets were prophesying the same, saying, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and triumph, for the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.” 
11022013	Then the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah instructed him, “Behold now, with one accord the words of the prophets are favorable to the king. So please let your words be like theirs, and speak favorably.” 
11022014	But Micaiah said, “As surely as the LORD lives, I will speak whatever the LORD tells me.” 
11022015	When Micaiah arrived, the king asked him, “Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we refrain?” “Go up and triumph,” Micaiah replied, “for the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.” 
11022016	But the king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear not to tell me anything but the truth in the name of the LORD?” 
11022017	So Micaiah declared: “I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd. And the LORD said, ‘These people have no master; let each one return home in peace.’” 
11022018	Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you that he never prophesies good for me, but only bad?” 
11022019	Micaiah continued, “Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left. 
11022020	And the LORD said, ‘Who will entice Ahab to march up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’ And one suggested this, and another that. 
11022021	Then a spirit came forward, stood before the LORD, and said, ‘I will entice him.’ ‘By what means?’ asked the LORD. 
11022022	And he replied, ‘I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.’ ‘You will surely entice him and prevail,’ said the LORD. ‘Go and do it.’ 
11022023	So you see, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours, and the LORD has pronounced disaster against you.” 
11022024	Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah went up, struck Micaiah in the face, and demanded, “Which way did the Spirit of the LORD go when He departed from me to speak with you?” 
11022025	Micaiah replied, “You will soon see, on that day when you go and hide in an inner room.” 
11022026	And the king of Israel declared, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son, 
11022027	and tell them that this is what the king says: ‘Put this man in prison and feed him only bread and water until I return safely.’” 
11022028	But Micaiah replied, “If you ever return safely, the LORD has not spoken through me.” Then he added, “Take heed, all you people!” 
11022029	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. 
11022030	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle. 
11022031	Now the king of Aram had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, “Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel.” 
11022032	When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “Surely this is the king of Israel!” So they turned to fight against him, but Jehoshaphat cried out. 
11022033	And when the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him. 
11022034	However, a certain man drew his bow without taking special aim, and he struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. So the king said to his charioteer, “Turn around and take me out of the battle, for I am badly wounded!” 
11022035	The battle raged throughout that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. And the blood from his wound ran out onto the floor of the chariot, and that evening he died. 
11022036	As the sun was setting, the cry rang out in the army: “Every man to his own city, and every man to his own land!” 
11022037	So the king died and was brought to Samaria, where they buried him. 
11022038	And the chariot was washed at the pool of Samaria where the prostitutes bathed, and the dogs licked up Ahab’s blood, according to the word that the LORD had spoken. 
11022039	As for the rest of the acts of Ahab, along with all his accomplishments and the ivory palace and all the cities he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
11022040	And Ahab rested with his fathers, and his son Ahaziah reigned in his place. 
11022041	In the fourth year of Ahab’s reign over Israel, Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king of Judah. 
11022042	Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother’s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi. 
11022043	And Jehoshaphat walked in all the ways of his father Asa; he did not turn away from them, but did what was right in the eyes of the LORD. The high places, however, were not removed; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. 
11022044	Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel. 
11022045	As for the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, along with the might he exercised and how he waged war, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
11022046	He banished from the land the male shrine prostitutes who remained from the days of his father Asa. 
11022047	And there was no king in Edom; a deputy served as king. 
11022048	Jehoshaphat built ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they never set sail, because they were wrecked at Ezion-geber. 
11022049	At that time Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my servants sail with your servants,” but Jehoshaphat refused. 
11022050	And Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of his father David. And his son Jehoram reigned in his place. 
11022051	In the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat’s reign over Judah, Ahaziah son of Ahab became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria two years. 
11022052	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the ways of his father and mother and of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin. 
11022053	Ahaziah served and worshiped Baal, provoking the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger, just as his father had done. 
12001001	After the death of Ahab, Moab rebelled against Israel. 
12001002	Now Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria and injured himself. So he sent messengers and instructed them: “Go inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover from this injury.” 
12001003	But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are on your way to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?’ 
12001004	Therefore this is what the LORD says: ‘You will not get up from the bed on which you are lying. You will surely die.’” So Elijah departed. 
12001005	When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them, “Why have you returned?” 
12001006	They replied, “A man came up to meet us and said, ‘Go back to the king who sent you and tell him that this is what the LORD says: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending these men to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not get up from the bed on which you are lying. You will surely die.’” 
12001007	The king asked them, “What sort of man came up to meet you and spoke these words to you?” 
12001008	“He was a hairy man,” they answered, “with a leather belt around his waist.” “It was Elijah the Tishbite,” said the king. 
12001009	Then King Ahaziah sent to Elijah a captain with his company of fifty men. So the captain went up to Elijah, who was sitting on top of a hill, and said to him, “Man of God, the king declares, ‘Come down!’” 
12001010	Elijah answered the captain, “If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men.” And fire came down from heaven and consumed the captain and his fifty men. 
12001011	So the king sent to Elijah another captain with his fifty men. And the captain said to Elijah, “Man of God, the king declares, ‘Come down at once!’” 
12001012	Again Elijah replied, “If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men.” And the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed the captain and his fifty men. 
12001013	So the king sent a third captain with his fifty men. And the third captain went up, fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, “Man of God, may my life and the lives of these fifty servants of yours please be precious in your sight. 
12001014	Behold, fire has come down from heaven and consumed the first two captains of fifty, with all their men. But now may my life be precious in your sight.” 
12001015	Then the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, “Go down with him. Do not be afraid of him.” So Elijah got up and went down with him to the king. 
12001016	And Elijah said to King Ahaziah, “This is what the LORD says: Is there really no God in Israel for you to inquire of His word? Is that why you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not get up from the bed on which you are lying. You will surely die.” 
12001017	So Ahaziah died according to the word of the LORD that Elijah had spoken. And since he had no son, Jehoram succeeded him in the second year of the reign of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat over Judah. 
12001018	As for the rest of the acts of Ahaziah, along with his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
12002001	Shortly before the LORD took Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal, 
12002002	and Elijah said to Elisha, “Please stay here, for the LORD has sent me on to Bethel.” But Elisha replied, “As surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So they went down to Bethel. 
12002003	Then the sons of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and said, “Do you know that the LORD will take your master away from you today?” “Yes, I know,” he replied. “Do not speak of it.” 
12002004	And Elijah said to Elisha, “Please stay here, for the LORD has sent me on to Jericho.” But Elisha replied, “As surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So they went to Jericho. 
12002005	Then the sons of the prophets at Jericho came up to Elisha and said, “Do you know that the LORD will take your master away from you today?” “Yes, I know,” he replied. “Do not speak of it.” 
12002006	And Elijah said to Elisha, “Please stay here, for the LORD has sent me on to the Jordan.” But Elisha replied, “As surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So the two of them went on. 
12002007	Then a company of fifty of the sons of the prophets went and stood at a distance, facing Elijah and Elisha as the two of them stood by the Jordan. 
12002008	And Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up, and struck the waters, which parted to the right and to the left, so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground. 
12002009	After they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken away from you?” “Please, let me inherit a double portion of your spirit,” Elisha replied. 
12002010	“You have requested a difficult thing,” said Elijah. “Nevertheless, if you see me as I am taken from you, it will be yours. But if not, then it will not be so.” 
12002011	As they were walking along and talking together, suddenly a chariot of fire with horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up into heaven in a whirlwind. 
12002012	As Elisha watched, he cried out, “My father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel!” And he saw Elijah no more. So taking hold of his own clothes, he tore them in two. 
12002013	Elisha also picked up the cloak that had fallen from Elijah, and he went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. 
12002014	Then he took the cloak of Elijah that had fallen from him and struck the waters. “Where now is the LORD, the God of Elijah?” he asked. And when he had struck the waters, they parted to the right and to the left, and Elisha crossed over. 
12002015	When the sons of the prophets who were watching him from Jericho saw what had happened, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” And they went to meet him and bowed down to the ground before him. 
12002016	“Look now,” they said to Elisha, “we your servants have fifty valiant men. Please let them go and search for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the LORD has taken him up and put him on one of the mountains or in one of the valleys.” “Do not send them,” Elisha replied. 
12002017	But when they pressed him to the point of embarrassment, he said, “Send them.” And they sent fifty men, who searched for three days but did not find Elijah. 
12002018	When they returned to Elisha, who was staying in Jericho, he said to them, “Didn’t I tell you not to go?” 
12002019	Then the men of the city said to Elisha, “Please note, our lord, that the city’s location is good, as you can see. But the water is bad and the land is unfruitful.” 
12002020	“Bring me a new bowl,” he replied, “and put some salt in it.” So they brought it to him, 
12002021	and Elisha went out to the spring, cast the salt into it, and said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘I have healed this water. No longer will it cause death or unfruitfulness.’” 
12002022	And the waters there have been healthy to this day, according to the word spoken by Elisha. 
12002023	From there, Elisha went up to Bethel, and as he was walking up the road, a group of boys came out of the city and jeered at him, chanting, “Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!” 
12002024	Then he turned around, looked at them, and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD. Suddenly two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys. 
12002025	And Elisha went on to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria. 
12003001	In the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat’s reign over Judah, Jehoram son of Ahab became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria twelve years. 
12003002	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as his father and mother had done. He removed the sacred pillar of Baal that his father had made. 
12003003	Nevertheless, he clung to the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit; he did not turn away from them. 
12003004	Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder, and he would render to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs and the wool of a hundred thousand rams. 
12003005	But after the death of Ahab, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. 
12003006	So at that time King Jehoram set out from Samaria and mobilized all Israel. 
12003007	And he sent a message to Jehoshaphat king of Judah: “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?” “I will go,” replied Jehoshaphat. “I am as you are, my people are your people, and my horses are your horses.” 
12003008	Then he asked, “Which way shall we go up?” “By way of the Desert of Edom,” replied Joram. 
12003009	So the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom set out, and after they had traveled a roundabout route for seven days, they had no water for their army or for their animals. 
12003010	“Alas,” said the king of Israel, “for the LORD has summoned these three kings to deliver them into the hand of Moab!” 
12003011	But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no prophet of the LORD here? Let us inquire of the LORD through him.” And one of the servants of the king of Israel answered, “Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He used to pour water on the hands of Elijah.” 
12003012	Jehoshaphat affirmed, “The word of the LORD is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him. 
12003013	Elisha, however, said to the king of Israel, “What have we to do with each other? Go to the prophets of your father and of your mother!” “No,” replied the king of Israel, “for it is the LORD who has summoned these three kings to deliver them into the hand of Moab.” 
12003014	Then Elisha said, “As surely as the LORD of Hosts lives, before whom I stand, were it not for my regard for the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not look at you or acknowledge you. 
12003015	But now, bring me a harpist.” And while the harpist played, the hand of the LORD came upon Elisha 
12003016	and he said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Dig this valley full of ditches.’ 
12003017	For the LORD says, ‘You will not see wind or rain, but the valley will be filled with water, and you will drink—you and your cattle and your animals.’ 
12003018	This is a simple matter in the sight of the LORD, and He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand. 
12003019	And you shall attack every fortified city and every city of importance. You shall cut down every good tree, stop up every spring, and ruin every good field with stones.” 
12003020	The next morning, at the time of the morning sacrifice, water suddenly flowed from the direction of Edom and filled the land. 
12003021	Now all the Moabites had heard that the kings had come up to fight against them. So all who could bear arms, young and old, were summoned and stationed at the border. 
12003022	When they got up early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water, and it looked as red as blood to the Moabites across the way. 
12003023	“This is blood!” they exclaimed. “The kings have clashed swords and slaughtered one another. Now to the plunder, Moab!” 
12003024	But when the Moabites came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and attacked them, and they fled before them. So the Israelites invaded their land and struck down the Moabites. 
12003025	They destroyed the cities, and each man threw stones on every good field until it was covered. They stopped up every spring and cut down every good tree. Only Kir-haraseth was left with stones in place, but men with slings surrounded it and attacked it as well. 
12003026	When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not prevail. 
12003027	So he took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him, and offered him as a burnt offering on the city wall. And there was great fury against the Israelites, so they withdrew and returned to their own land. 
12004001	Now the wife of one of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, “Your servant, my husband, is dead, and you know that your servant feared the LORD. And now his creditor is coming to take my two children as his slaves!” 
12004002	“How can I help you?” asked Elisha. “Tell me, what do you have in the house?” She answered, “Your servant has nothing in the house but a jar of oil.” 
12004003	“Go,” said Elisha, “borrow empty jars from all your neighbors. Do not gather just a few. 
12004004	Then go inside, shut the door behind you and your sons, and pour oil into all these jars, setting the full ones aside.” 
12004005	So she left him, and after she had shut the door behind her and her sons, they kept bringing jars to her, and she kept pouring. 
12004006	When all the jars were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another.” But he replied, “There are no more jars.” Then the oil stopped flowing. 
12004007	She went and told the man of God, and he said, “Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt. Then you and your sons can live on the remainder.” 
12004008	One day Elisha went to Shunem, and a prominent woman who lived there persuaded him to have a meal. So whenever he would pass by, he would stop there to eat. 
12004009	Then the woman said to her husband, “Behold, now I know that the one who often comes our way is a holy man of God. 
12004010	Please let us make a small room upstairs and put in it a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp for him. Then when he comes to us, he can stay there.” 
12004011	One day Elisha came to visit and went to his upper room to lie down. 
12004012	And he said to Gehazi his servant, “Call the Shunammite woman.” And when he had called her, she stood before him, 
12004013	and Elisha said to Gehazi, “Now tell her, ‘Look, you have gone to all this trouble for us. What can we do for you? Can we speak on your behalf to the king or the commander of the army?’” “I have a home among my own people,” she replied. 
12004014	So he asked, “Then what should be done for her?” “Well, she has no son,” Gehazi replied, “and her husband is old.” 
12004015	“Call her,” said Elisha. So Gehazi called her, and she stood in the doorway. 
12004016	And Elisha declared, “At this time next year, you will hold a son in your arms.” “No, my lord,” she said. “Do not lie to your maidservant, O man of God.” 
12004017	But the woman did conceive, and at that time the next year she gave birth to a son, just as Elisha had told her. 
12004018	And the child grew, and one day he went out to his father, who was with the harvesters. 
12004019	“My head! My head!” he complained to his father. So his father told a servant, “Carry him to his mother.” 
12004020	After the servant had picked him up and carried him to his mother, the boy sat on her lap until noon, and then he died. 
12004021	And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God. Then she shut the door and went out. 
12004022	And the woman called her husband and said, “Please send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, that I may go quickly to the man of God and return.” 
12004023	“Why would you go to him today?” he replied. “It is not a New Moon or a Sabbath.” “Everything is all right,” she said. 
12004024	Then she saddled the donkey and told her servant, “Drive onward; do not slow the pace for me unless I tell you.” 
12004025	So she set out and went to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her at a distance, he said to his servant Gehazi, “Look, there is the Shunammite woman. 
12004026	Please run out now to meet her and ask, ‘Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is your child all right?’” And she answered, “Everything is all right.” 
12004027	When she reached the man of God at the mountain, she clung to his feet. Gehazi came over to push her away, but the man of God said, “Leave her alone, for her soul is in deep distress, and the LORD has hidden it from me and has not told me.” 
12004028	Then she said, “Did I ask you for a son, my lord? Didn’t I say, ‘Do not deceive me?’” 
12004029	So Elisha said to Gehazi, “Tie up your garment, take my staff in your hand, and go! If you meet anyone, do not greet him, and if anyone greets you, do not answer him. Then lay my staff on the boy’s face.” 
12004030	And the mother of the boy said, “As surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So he got up and followed her. 
12004031	Gehazi went on ahead of them and laid the staff on the boy’s face, but there was no sound or response. So he went back to meet Elisha and told him, “The boy has not awakened.” 
12004032	When Elisha reached the house, there was the boy lying dead on his bed. 
12004033	So he went in, closed the door behind the two of them, and prayed to the LORD. 
12004034	Then Elisha got on the bed and lay on the boy, mouth to mouth, eye to eye, and hand to hand. As he stretched himself out over him, the boy’s body became warm. 
12004035	Elisha turned away and paced back and forth across the room. Then he got on the bed and stretched himself out over the boy again, and the boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes. 
12004036	Elisha summoned Gehazi and said, “Call the Shunammite woman.” So he called her and she came. Then Elisha said, “Pick up your son.” 
12004037	She came in, fell at his feet, and bowed to the ground. Then she picked up her son and went out. 
12004038	When Elisha returned to Gilgal, there was a famine in the land. As the sons of the prophets were sitting at his feet, he said to his attendant, “Put on the large pot and boil some stew for the sons of the prophets.” 
12004039	One of them went out to the field to gather herbs, and he found a wild vine from which he gathered as many wild gourds as his garment could hold. Then he came back and cut them up into the pot of stew, though no one knew what they were. 
12004040	And they poured it out for the men to eat, but when they tasted the stew they cried out, “There is death in the pot, O man of God!” And they could not eat it. 
12004041	Then Elisha said, “Get some flour.” He threw it into the pot and said, “Pour it out for the people to eat.” And there was nothing harmful in the pot. 
12004042	Now a man from Baal-shalishah came to the man of God with a sack of twenty loaves of barley bread from the first ripe grain. “Give it to the people to eat,” said Elisha. 
12004043	But his servant asked, “How am I to set twenty loaves before a hundred men?” “Give it to the people to eat,” said Elisha, “for this is what the LORD says: ‘They will eat and have some left over.’” 
12004044	So he set it before them, and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of the LORD. 
12005001	Now Naaman, the commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man in his master’s sight and highly regarded, for through him the LORD had given victory to Aram. And he was a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper. 
12005002	At this time the Arameans had gone out in bands and had taken a young girl from the land of Israel, and she was serving Naaman’s wife. 
12005003	She said to her mistress, “If only my master would go to the prophet who is in Samaria, he would cure him of his leprosy.” 
12005004	And Naaman went and told his master what the girl from the land of Israel had said. 
12005005	“Go now,” said the king of Aram, “and I will send you with a letter to the king of Israel.” So Naaman departed, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten sets of clothing. 
12005006	And the letter that he took to the king of Israel stated: “With this letter I am sending my servant Naaman, so that you may cure him of his leprosy.” 
12005007	When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and asked, “Am I God, killing and giving life, that this man expects me to cure a leper? Surely you can see that he is seeking a quarrel with me!” 
12005008	Now when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent a message to the king: “Why have you torn your clothes? Please let the man come to me, and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel.” 
12005009	So Naaman came with his horses and chariots and stood at the door of Elisha’s house. 
12005010	Then Elisha sent him a messenger, who said, “Go and wash yourself seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will be restored, and you will be clean.” 
12005011	But Naaman went away angry, saying, “I thought that he would surely come out, stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the spot to cure my leprosy. 
12005012	Are not the Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not have washed in them and been cleansed?” So he turned and went away in a rage. 
12005013	Naaman’s servants, however, approached him and said, “My father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more, then, when he tells you, ‘Wash and be cleansed’?” 
12005014	So Naaman went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, according to the word of the man of God, and his flesh was restored and became like that of a little child, and he was clean. 
12005015	Then Naaman and all his attendants went back to the man of God, stood before him, and declared, “Now I know for sure that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel. So please accept a gift from your servant.” 
12005016	But Elisha replied, “As surely as the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will not accept it.” And although Naaman urged him to accept it, he refused. 
12005017	“If you will not,” said Naaman, “please let me, your servant, be given as much soil as a pair of mules can carry. For your servant will never again make a burnt offering or a sacrifice to any other god but the LORD. 
12005018	Yet may the LORD forgive your servant this one thing: When my master goes into the temple of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my arm, and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the LORD forgive your servant in this matter.” 
12005019	“Go in peace,” said Elisha. But after Naaman had traveled a short distance, 
12005020	Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, “Look, my master has spared this Aramean, Naaman, by not accepting what he brought. As surely as the LORD lives, I will run after him and get something from him.” 
12005021	So Gehazi pursued Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running toward him, he got down from the chariot to meet him and asked, “Is everything all right?” 
12005022	“Everything is all right,” Gehazi replied. “My master has sent me to say, ‘Look, two young men from the sons of the prophets have just now come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two sets of clothing.’” 
12005023	But Naaman insisted, “Please, take two talents.” And he urged Gehazi to accept them. Then he tied up two talents of silver in two bags along with two sets of clothing and gave them to two of his servants, who carried them ahead of Gehazi. 
12005024	When Gehazi came to the hill, he took the gifts from the servants and stored them in the house. Then he dismissed the men, and they departed. 
12005025	When Gehazi went in and stood before his master, Elisha asked him, “Gehazi, where have you been?” “Your servant did not go anywhere,” he replied. 
12005026	But Elisha questioned him, “Did not my spirit go with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to accept money and clothing, olive groves and vineyards, sheep and oxen, menservants and maidservants? 
12005027	Therefore, the leprosy of Naaman will cling to you and your descendants forever!” And as Gehazi left his presence, he was leprous—as white as snow. 
12006001	Now the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “Please take note that the place where we meet with you is too small for us. 
12006002	Please let us go to the Jordan, where each of us can get a log so we can build ourselves a place to live there.” “Go,” said Elisha. 
12006003	Then one of them said, “Please come with your servants.” “I will come,” he replied. 
12006004	So Elisha went with them, and when they came to the Jordan, they began to cut down some trees. 
12006005	As one of them was cutting down a tree, the iron axe head fell into the water. “Oh, my master,” he cried out, “it was borrowed!” 
12006006	“Where did it fall?” asked the man of God. And when he showed him the place, the man of God cut a stick, threw it there, and made the iron float. 
12006007	“Lift it out,” he said, and the man reached out his hand and took it. 
12006008	Now the king of Aram was at war against Israel. After consulting with his servants, he said, “My camp will be in such and such a place.” 
12006009	Then the man of God sent word to the king of Israel: “Be careful not to pass by this place, for the Arameans are going down there.” 
12006010	So the king of Israel sent word to the place the man of God had pointed out. Time and again Elisha warned the king, so that he was on his guard in such places. 
12006011	For this reason the king of Aram became enraged and called his servants to demand of them, “Tell me, which one of us is on the side of the king of Israel?” 
12006012	But one of his servants replied, “No one, my lord the king. For Elisha, the prophet in Israel, tells the king of Israel the very words you speak in your bedroom.” 
12006013	So the king said, “Go and see where he is, that I may send men to capture him.” On receiving the report, “Elisha is in Dothan,” 
12006014	the king of Aram sent horses, chariots, and a great army. They went there by night and surrounded the city. 
12006015	When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early in the morning, behold, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. So he asked Elisha, “Oh, my master, what are we to do?” 
12006016	“Do not be afraid,” Elisha answered, “for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.” 
12006017	Then Elisha prayed, “O LORD, please open his eyes that he may see.” And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw that the hills were full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha. 
12006018	As the Arameans came down against him, Elisha prayed to the LORD, “Please strike these people with blindness.” So He struck them with blindness, according to the word of Elisha. 
12006019	And Elisha told them, “This is not the way, and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will take you to the man you are seeking.” And he led them to Samaria. 
12006020	When they had entered Samaria, Elisha said, “O LORD, open the eyes of these men that they may see.” Then the LORD opened their eyes, and they looked around and discovered that they were in Samaria. 
12006021	And when the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, “My father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?” 
12006022	“Do not kill them,” he replied. “Would you kill those you have captured with your own sword or bow? Set food and water before them, that they may eat and drink and then return to their master.” 
12006023	So the king prepared a great feast for them, and after they had finished eating and drinking, he sent them away, and they returned to their master. And the Aramean raiders did not come into the land of Israel again. 
12006024	Some time later, Ben-hadad king of Aram assembled his entire army and marched up to besiege Samaria. 
12006025	So there was a great famine in Samaria. Indeed, they besieged the city so long that a donkey’s head sold for eighty shekels of silver, and a quarter cab of dove’s dung sold for five shekels of silver. 
12006026	As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, “Help me, my lord the king!” 
12006027	He answered, “If the LORD does not help you, where can I find help for you? From the threshing floor or the winepress?” 
12006028	Then the king asked her, “What is the matter?” And she answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give up your son, that we may eat him, and tomorrow we will eat my son.’ 
12006029	So we boiled my son and ate him, and the next day I said to her, ‘Give up your son, that we may eat him.’ But she had hidden her son.” 
12006030	When the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his clothes. And as he passed by on the wall, the people saw the sackcloth under his clothes next to his skin. 
12006031	He announced, “May God punish me, and ever so severely, if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders through this day!” 
12006032	Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. The king sent a messenger ahead, but before he arrived, Elisha said to the elders, “Do you see how this murderer has sent someone to cut off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door to keep him out. Is not the sound of his master’s footsteps behind him?” 
12006033	While Elisha was still speaking with them, the messenger came down to him. And the king said, “This calamity is from the LORD. Why should I wait for the LORD any longer?” 
12007001	Then Elisha said, “Hear the word of the LORD! This is what the LORD says: ‘About this time tomorrow at the gate of Samaria, a seah of fine flour will sell for a shekel, and two seahs of barley will sell for a shekel.’” 
12007002	But the officer on whose arm the king leaned answered the man of God, “Look, even if the LORD were to make windows in heaven, could this really happen?” “You will see it with your own eyes,” replied Elisha, “but you will not eat any of it.” 
12007003	Now there were four men with leprosy at the entrance of the city gate, and they said to one another, “Why just sit here until we die? 
12007004	If we say, ‘Let us go into the city,’ we will die there from the famine in the city; but if we sit here, we will also die. So come now, let us go over to the camp of the Arameans. If they let us live, we will live; if they kill us, we will die.” 
12007005	So they arose at twilight and went to the camp of the Arameans. But when they came to the outskirts of the camp, there was not a man to be found. 
12007006	For the Lord had caused the Arameans to hear the sound of chariots, horses, and a great army, so that they said to one another, “Look, the king of Israel must have hired the kings of the Hittites and Egyptians to attack us.” 
12007007	Thus the Arameans had arisen and fled at twilight, abandoning their tents and horses and donkeys. The camp was intact, and they had run for their lives. 
12007008	When the lepers reached the edge of the camp, they went into a tent to eat and drink. Then they carried off the silver, gold, and clothing, and went and hid them. On returning, they entered another tent, carried off some items from there, and hid them. 
12007009	Finally, they said to one another, “We are not doing what is right. Today is a day of good news. If we are silent and wait until morning light, our sin will overtake us. Now, therefore, let us go and tell the king’s household.” 
12007010	So they went and called out to the gatekeepers of the city, saying, “We went to the Aramean camp and no one was there—not a trace—only tethered horses and donkeys, and the tents were intact.” 
12007011	The gatekeepers shouted the news, and it was reported to the king’s household. 
12007012	So the king got up in the night and said to his servants, “Let me tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know we are starving, so they have left the camp to hide in the field, thinking, ‘When they come out of the city, we will take them alive and enter the city.’” 
12007013	But one of his servants replied, “Please, have scouts take five of the horses that remain in the city. Their plight will be no worse than all the Israelites who are left here. You can see that all the Israelites here are doomed. So let us send them and find out.” 
12007014	Then the scouts took two chariots with horses, and the king sent them after the Aramean army, saying, “Go and see.” 
12007015	And they tracked them as far as the Jordan, and indeed, the whole way was littered with the clothing and equipment the Arameans had thrown off in haste. So the scouts returned and told the king. 
12007016	Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. It was then that a seah of fine flour sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley sold for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD. 
12007017	Now the king had appointed the officer on whose arm he leaned to be in charge of the gate, but the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died, just as the man of God had foretold when the king had come to him. 
12007018	It happened just as the man of God had told the king: “About this time tomorrow at the gate of Samaria, two seahs of barley will sell for a shekel, and a seah of fine flour will sell for a shekel.” 
12007019	And the officer had answered the man of God, “Look, even if the LORD were to make windows in heaven, could this really happen?” So Elisha had replied, “You will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of it!” 
12007020	And that is just what happened to him. The people trampled him in the gateway, and he died. 
12008001	Now Elisha had said to the woman whose son he had restored to life, “Arise, you and your household; go and live as a foreigner wherever you can. For the LORD has decreed that a seven-year famine will come to the land.” 
12008002	So the woman had proceeded to do as the man of God had instructed. And she and her household lived as foreigners for seven years in the land of the Philistines. 
12008003	At the end of seven years, when the woman returned from the land of the Philistines, she went to the king to appeal for her house and her land. 
12008004	Now the king had been speaking to Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, “Please relate to me all the great things Elisha has done.” 
12008005	And Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had brought the dead back to life. Just then the woman whose son Elisha had revived came to appeal to the king for her house and her land. So Gehazi said, “My lord the king, this is the woman, and this is the son Elisha restored to life.” 
12008006	When the king asked the woman, she confirmed it. So the king appointed for her an officer, saying, “Restore all that was hers, along with all the proceeds of the field from the day that she left the country until now.” 
12008007	Then Elisha came to Damascus while Ben-hadad king of Aram was sick, and the king was told, “The man of God has come here.” 
12008008	So the king said to Hazael, “Take a gift in your hand, go to meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD through him, ‘Will I recover from this illness?’” 
12008009	So Hazael went to meet Elisha, taking with him a gift of forty camel loads of every good thing from Damascus. And he went in and stood before him and said, “Your son Ben-hadad king of Aram has sent me to ask, ‘Will I recover from this illness?’” 
12008010	Elisha answered, “Go and tell him, ‘You will surely recover.’ But the LORD has shown me that in fact he will die.” 
12008011	Elisha fixed his gaze steadily on him until Hazael became uncomfortable. Then the man of God began to weep. 
12008012	“Why is my lord weeping?” asked Hazael. “Because I know the evil you will do to the Israelites,” Elisha replied. “You will set fire to their fortresses, kill their young men with the sword, dash their little ones to pieces, and rip open their pregnant women.” 
12008013	“But how could your servant, a mere dog, do such a monstrous thing?” said Hazael. And Elisha answered, “The LORD has shown me that you will be king over Aram.” 
12008014	So Hazael left Elisha and went to his master, who asked him, “What did Elisha say to you?” And he replied, “He told me that you would surely recover.” 
12008015	But the next day Hazael took a thick cloth, dipped it in water, and spread it over the king’s face. So Ben-hadad died, and Hazael reigned in his place. 
12008016	In the fifth year of the reign of Joram son of Ahab over Israel, Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat succeeded his father as king of Judah. 
12008017	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. 
12008018	And Jehoram walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done. For he married a daughter of Ahab and did evil in the sight of the LORD. 
12008019	Yet for the sake of His servant David, the LORD was unwilling to destroy Judah, since He had promised to maintain a lamp for David and his descendants forever. 
12008020	In the days of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against the hand of Judah and appointed their own king. 
12008021	So Jehoram crossed over to Zair with all his chariots. When the Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, he rose up and attacked by night. His troops, however, fled to their homes. 
12008022	So to this day Edom has been in rebellion against the hand of Judah. Likewise, Libnah rebelled at the same time. 
12008023	As for the rest of the acts of Jehoram, along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
12008024	And Jehoram rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David. And his son Ahaziah reigned in his place. 
12008025	In the twelfth year of the reign of Joram son of Ahab over Israel, Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah. 
12008026	Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother’s name was Athaliah, the granddaughter of Omri king of Israel. 
12008027	And Ahaziah walked in the ways of the house of Ahab and did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab, for he was a son-in-law of the house of Ahab. 
12008028	Then Ahaziah went with Joram son of Ahab to fight against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead, and the Arameans wounded Joram. 
12008029	So King Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds that the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramah when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to visit Joram son of Ahab, because Joram had been wounded. 
12009001	Now Elisha the prophet summoned one of the sons of the prophets and said to him, “Tuck your cloak under your belt, take this flask of oil, and go to Ramoth-gilead. 
12009002	When you arrive, look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go in, get him away from his companions, and take him to an inner room. 
12009003	Then take the flask of oil, pour it on his head, and declare, ‘This is what the LORD says: I anoint you king over Israel.’ Then open the door and run. Do not delay!” 
12009004	So the young prophet went to Ramoth-gilead, 
12009005	and when he arrived, the army commanders were sitting there. “I have a message for you, commander,” he said. “For which of us?” asked Jehu. “For you, commander,” he replied. 
12009006	So Jehu got up and went into the house, where the young prophet poured the oil on his head and declared, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anoint you king over the LORD’s people Israel. 
12009007	And you are to strike down the house of your master Ahab, so that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets and the blood of all the servants of the LORD shed by the hand of Jezebel. 
12009008	The whole house of Ahab will perish, and I will cut off from Ahab every male, both slave and free, in Israel. 
12009009	I will make the house of Ahab like the houses of Jeroboam son of Nebat and Baasha son of Ahijah. 
12009010	And on the plot of ground at Jezreel the dogs will devour Jezebel, and there will be no one to bury her.’” Then the young prophet opened the door and ran. 
12009011	When Jehu went out to the servants of his master, they asked, “Is everything all right? Why did this madman come to you?” “You know his kind and their babble,” he replied. 
12009012	“That is a lie!” they said. “Tell us now!” So Jehu answered, “He talked to me about this and that, saying, ‘This is what the LORD says: I anoint you king over Israel.’” 
12009013	Quickly, each man took his garment and put it under Jehu on the bare steps. Then they blew the ram’s horn and proclaimed, “Jehu is king!” 
12009014	Thus Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram and all Israel had been defending Ramoth-gilead against Hazael king of Aram, 
12009015	but King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he had suffered at the hands of the Arameans in the battle against Hazael their king.) So Jehu said, “If you commanders wish to make me king, then do not let anyone escape from the city to go and tell it in Jezreel.” 
12009016	Then Jehu got into his chariot and went to Jezreel, because Joram was laid up there. And Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see him. 
12009017	Now the watchman standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu’s troops approaching, and he called out, “I see a company of troops!” “Choose a rider,” Joram commanded. “Send him out to meet them and ask, ‘Have you come in peace?’” 
12009018	So a horseman rode off to meet Jehu and said, “This is what the king asks: ‘Have you come in peace?’” “What do you know about peace?” Jehu replied. “Fall in behind me.” And the watchman reported, “The messenger reached them, but he is not coming back.” 
12009019	So the king sent out a second horseman, who went to them and said, “This is what the king asks: ‘Have you come in peace?’” “What do you know about peace?” Jehu replied. “Fall in behind me.” 
12009020	Again the watchman reported, “He reached them, but he is not coming back. And the charioteer is driving like Jehu son of Nimshi —he is driving like a madman!” 
12009021	“Harness!” Joram shouted, and they harnessed his chariot. Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah set out, each in his own chariot, and met Jehu on the property of Naboth the Jezreelite. 
12009022	When Joram saw Jehu, he asked, “Have you come in peace, Jehu?” “How can there be peace,” he replied, “as long as the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel abound?” 
12009023	Joram turned around and fled, calling out to Ahaziah, “Treachery, Ahaziah!” 
12009024	Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders. The arrow pierced his heart, and he slumped down in his chariot. 
12009025	And Jehu said to Bidkar his officer, “Pick him up and throw him into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. For remember that when you and I were riding together behind his father Ahab, the LORD lifted up this burden against him: 
12009026	‘As surely as I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons yesterday, declares the LORD, so will I repay you on this plot of ground, declares the LORD.’ Now then, according to the word of the LORD, pick him up and throw him on the plot of ground.” 
12009027	When King Ahaziah of Judah saw this, he fled up the road toward Beth-haggan. And Jehu pursued him, shouting, “Shoot him too!” So they shot Ahaziah in his chariot on the Ascent of Gur, near Ibleam, and he fled to Megiddo and died there. 
12009028	Then his servants carried him by chariot to Jerusalem and buried him with his fathers in his tomb in the City of David. 
12009029	(In the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king over Judah.) 
12009030	Now when Jehu arrived in Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it. So she painted her eyes, adorned her head, and looked down from a window. 
12009031	And as Jehu entered the gate, she asked, “Have you come in peace, O Zimri, murderer of your master?” 
12009032	He looked up at the window and called out, “Who is on my side? Who?” And two or three eunuchs looked down at him. 
12009033	“Throw her down!” yelled Jehu. So they threw her down, and her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses as they trampled her underfoot. 
12009034	Then Jehu went in and ate and drank. “Take care of this cursed woman,” he said, “and bury her, for she was the daughter of a king.” 
12009035	But when they went out to bury her, they found nothing but her skull, her feet, and the palms of her hands. 
12009036	So they went back and told Jehu, who replied, “This is the word of the LORD, which He spoke through His servant Elijah the Tishbite: ‘On the plot of ground at Jezreel the dogs will devour the flesh of Jezebel. 
12009037	And Jezebel’s body will lie like dung in the field on the plot of ground at Jezreel, so that no one can say: This is Jezebel.’” 
12010001	Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria to the officials of Jezreel, to the elders, and to the guardians of the sons of Ahab, saying: 
12010002	“When this letter arrives, since your master’s sons are with you and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city and weaponry, 
12010003	select the best and most worthy son of your master, set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.” 
12010004	But they were terrified and reasoned, “If two kings could not stand against him, how can we?” 
12010005	So the palace administrator, the overseer of the city, the elders, and the guardians sent a message to Jehu: “We are your servants, and we will do whatever you say. We will not make anyone king. Do whatever is good in your sight.” 
12010006	Then Jehu wrote them a second letter and said: “If you are on my side, and if you will obey me, then bring the heads of your master’s sons to me at Jezreel by this time tomorrow.” Now the sons of the king, seventy in all, were being brought up by the leading men of the city. 
12010007	And when the letter arrived, they took the sons of the king and slaughtered all seventy of them. They put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel. 
12010008	When the messenger arrived, he told Jehu, “They have brought the heads of the sons of the king.” And Jehu ordered, “Pile them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning.” 
12010009	The next morning, Jehu went out and stood before all the people and said, “You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him. But who killed all these? 
12010010	Know, then, that not a word the LORD has spoken against the house of Ahab will fail, for the LORD has done what He promised through His servant Elijah.” 
12010011	So Jehu killed everyone in Jezreel who remained of the house of Ahab, as well as all his great men and close friends and priests, leaving him without a single survivor. 
12010012	Then Jehu set out toward Samaria. At Beth-eked of the Shepherds, 
12010013	Jehu met some relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and asked, “Who are you?” “We are relatives of Ahaziah,” they answered, “and we have come down to greet the sons of the king and of the queen mother.” 
12010014	Then Jehu ordered, “Take them alive.” So his men took them alive, then slaughtered them at the well of Beth-eked—forty-two men. He spared none of them. 
12010015	When he left there, he found Jehonadab son of Rechab, who was coming to meet him. Jehu greeted him and asked, “Is your heart as true to mine as my heart is to yours?” “It is!” Jehonadab replied. “If it is,” said Jehu, “give me your hand.” So he gave him his hand, and Jehu helped him into his chariot, 
12010016	saying, “Come with me and see my zeal for the LORD!” So he had him ride in his chariot. 
12010017	When Jehu came to Samaria, he struck down everyone belonging to Ahab who remained there, until he had destroyed them, according to the word that the LORD had spoken to Elijah. 
12010018	Then Jehu brought all the people together and said, “Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu will serve him a lot. 
12010019	Now, therefore, summon to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests. See that no one is missing, for I have a great sacrifice for Baal. Whoever is missing will not live.” But Jehu was acting deceptively in order to destroy the servants of Baal. 
12010020	And Jehu commanded, “Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal.” So they announced it. 
12010021	Then Jehu sent word throughout Israel, and all the servants of Baal came; there was not a man who failed to show. They entered the temple of Baal, and it was filled from end to end. 
12010022	And Jehu said to the keeper of the wardrobe, “Bring out garments for all the servants of Baal.” So he brought out garments for them. 
12010023	Next, Jehu and Jehonadab son of Rechab entered the temple of Baal, and Jehu said to the servants of Baal, “Look around to see that there are no servants of the LORD here among you—only servants of Baal.” 
12010024	And they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed eighty men outside and warned them, “If anyone allows one of the men I am delivering into your hands to escape, he will forfeit his life for theirs.” 
12010025	When he had finished making the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guards and officers, “Go in and kill them. Do not let anyone out.” So the guards and officers put them to the sword, threw the bodies out, and went into the inner room of the temple of Baal. 
12010026	They brought out the sacred pillar of the temple of Baal and burned it. 
12010027	They also demolished the sacred pillar of Baal. Then they tore down the temple of Baal and made it into a latrine, which it is to this day. 
12010028	Thus Jehu eradicated Baal from Israel, 
12010029	but he did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit—the worship of the golden calves at Bethel and Dan. 
12010030	Nevertheless, the LORD said to Jehu, “Because you have done well in carrying out what is right in My sight and have done to the house of Ahab all that was in My heart, four generations of your sons will sit on the throne of Israel.” 
12010031	Yet Jehu was not careful to follow the instruction of the LORD, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit. 
12010032	In those days the LORD began to reduce the size of Israel. Hazael defeated the Israelites throughout their territory 
12010033	from the Jordan eastward through all the land of Gilead (the region of Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh), and from Aroer by the Arnon Valley through Gilead to Bashan. 
12010034	As for the rest of the acts of Jehu, along with all his accomplishments and all his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
12010035	And Jehu rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria, and his son Jehoahaz reigned in his place. 
12010036	So the duration of Jehu’s reign over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years. 
12011001	When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she proceeded to annihilate all the royal heirs. 
12011002	But Jehosheba daughter of King Joram, the sister of Ahaziah, took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the sons of the king who were being murdered. She put him and his nurse in a bedroom to hide him from Athaliah, and he was not killed. 
12011003	And Joash remained hidden with his nurse in the house of the LORD for six years while Athaliah ruled the land. 
12011004	Then in the seventh year, Jehoiada sent for the commanders of hundreds, the Carites, and the guards, and had them brought into the house of the LORD. There he made a covenant with them and put them under oath. He showed them the king’s son 
12011005	and commanded them, “This is what you are to do: A third of you who come on duty on the Sabbath shall guard the royal palace, 
12011006	a third shall be at the gate of Sur, and a third at the gate behind the guards. You are to take turns guarding the temple— 
12011007	the two divisions that would go off duty on the Sabbath are to guard the house of the LORD for the king. 
12011008	You must surround the king with weapons in hand, and anyone who approaches the ranks must be put to death. You must stay close to the king wherever he goes.” 
12011009	So the commanders of hundreds did everything that Jehoiada the priest had ordered. Each of them took his men—those coming on duty on the Sabbath and those going off duty—and came to Jehoiada the priest. 
12011010	Then the priest gave to the commanders of hundreds the spears and shields of King David from the house of the LORD. 
12011011	And the guards stood with weapons in hand surrounding the king by the altar and the temple, from the south side to the north side of the temple. 
12011012	Then Jehoiada brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, presented him with the Testimony, and proclaimed him king. They anointed him, and the people clapped their hands and declared, “Long live the king!” 
12011013	When Athaliah heard the noise from the guards and the people, she went out to the people in the house of the LORD. 
12011014	And she looked out and saw the king standing by the pillar, according to the custom. The officers and trumpeters were beside the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and screamed, “Treason! Treason!” 
12011015	And Jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders of hundreds in charge of the army, “Bring her out between the ranks, and put to the sword anyone who follows her.” For the priest had said, “She must not be put to death in the house of the LORD.” 
12011016	So they seized Athaliah as she reached the horses’ entrance to the palace grounds, and there she was put to death. 
12011017	Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people that they would be the LORD’s people. He also made a covenant between the king and the people. 
12011018	So all the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols to pieces, and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars. And Jehoiada the priest posted guards for the house of the LORD. 
12011019	He took with him the commanders of hundreds, the Carites, the guards, and all the people of the land, and they brought the king down from the house of the LORD and entered the royal palace by way of the Gate of the Guards. Then Joash took his seat on the royal throne, 
12011020	and all the people of the land rejoiced. And the city was quiet, because Athaliah had been put to the sword at the royal palace. 
12011021	Joash was seven years old when he became king. 
12012001	In the seventh year of Jehu, Joash became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years. His mother’s name was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba. 
12012002	And Joash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD all the days he was instructed by Jehoiada the priest. 
12012003	Nevertheless, the high places were not removed; the people continued sacrificing and burning incense there. 
12012004	Then Joash said to the priests, “Collect all the money brought as sacred gifts into the house of the LORD—the census money, the money from vows, and the money brought voluntarily into the house of the LORD. 
12012005	Let every priest receive it from his constituency, and let it be used to repair any damage found in the temple.” 
12012006	By the twenty-third year of the reign of Joash, however, the priests had not yet repaired the damage to the temple. 
12012007	So King Joash called Jehoiada and the other priests and said, “Why have you not repaired the damage to the temple? Now, therefore, take no more money from your constituency, but hand it over for the repair of the temple.” 
12012008	So the priests agreed that they would not receive money from the people and that they would not repair the temple themselves. 
12012009	Then Jehoiada the priest took a chest, bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar on the right side as one enters the house of the LORD. There the priests who guarded the threshold put all the money brought into the house of the LORD. 
12012010	Whenever they saw that there was a large amount of money in the chest, the royal scribe and the high priest would go up, count the money brought into the house of the LORD, and tie it up in bags. 
12012011	Then they would put the counted money into the hands of those who supervised the work on the house of the LORD, who in turn would pay those doing the work—the carpenters, builders, 
12012012	masons, and stonecutters. They also purchased timber and dressed stone to repair the damage to the house of the LORD, and they paid the other expenses of the temple repairs. 
12012013	However, the money brought into the house of the LORD was not used for making silver basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, trumpets, or any articles of gold or silver for the house of the LORD. 
12012014	Instead, it was paid to those doing the work, and with it they repaired the house of the LORD. 
12012015	No accounting was required from the men who received the money to pay the workmen, because they acted with integrity. 
12012016	The money from the guilt offerings and sin offerings was not brought into the house of the LORD; it belonged to the priests. 
12012017	At that time Hazael king of Aram marched up and fought against Gath and captured it. Then he decided to attack Jerusalem. 
12012018	So King Joash of Judah took all the sacred objects dedicated by his fathers—Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah, the kings of Judah—along with his own consecrated items and all the gold found in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and the royal palace, and he sent them to Hazael king of Aram. So Hazael withdrew from Jerusalem. 
12012019	As for the rest of the acts of Joash, along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
12012020	And the servants of Joash rose up and formed a conspiracy and killed him at Beth-millo, on the road down to Silla. 
12012021	His servants Jozabad son of Shimeath and Jehozabad son of Shomer struck him down, and he died. And they buried him with his fathers in the City of David, and his son Amaziah reigned in his place. 
12013001	In the twenty-third year of the reign of Joash son of Ahaziah over Judah, Jehoahaz son of Jehu became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria seventeen years. 
12013002	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD and followed the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit; he did not turn away from them. 
12013003	So the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He delivered them continually into the hands of Hazael king of Aram and his son Ben-hadad. 
12013004	Then Jehoahaz sought the favor of the LORD, and the LORD listened to him because He saw the oppression that the king of Aram had inflicted on Israel. 
12013005	So the LORD gave Israel a deliverer, and they escaped the power of the Arameans. Then the people of Israel lived in their own homes as they had before. 
12013006	Nevertheless, they did not turn away from the sins that the house of Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit, but they continued to walk in them. The Asherah pole even remained standing in Samaria. 
12013007	Jehoahaz had no army left, except fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers, because the king of Aram had destroyed them and made them like the dust at threshing. 
12013008	As for the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, along with all his accomplishments and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
12013009	And Jehoahaz rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria. And his son Jehoash reigned in his place. 
12013010	In the thirty-seventh year of the reign of Joash over Judah, Jehoash son of Jehoahaz became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned sixteen years. 
12013011	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD and did not turn away from all the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit, but he walked in them. 
12013012	As for the rest of the acts of Jehoash, along with all his accomplishments and his might, including his war against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
12013013	And Jehoash rested with his fathers, and Jeroboam succeeded him on the throne. Jehoash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. 
12013014	When Elisha had fallen sick with the illness from which he would die, Jehoash king of Israel came down to him and wept over him, saying, “My father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel!” 
12013015	Elisha told him, “Take a bow and some arrows.” So Jehoash took a bow and some arrows. 
12013016	Then Elisha said to the king of Israel, “Put your hand on the bow.” So the king put his hand on the bow, and Elisha put his hands on the king’s hands. 
12013017	“Open the east window,” said Elisha. So he opened it and Elisha said, “Shoot!” So he shot. And Elisha declared: “This is the LORD’s arrow of victory, the arrow of victory over Aram, for you shall strike the Arameans in Aphek until you have put an end to them.” 
12013018	Then Elisha said, “Take the arrows!” So he took them, and Elisha said to the king of Israel, “Strike the ground!” So he struck the ground three times and stopped. 
12013019	But the man of God was angry with him and said, “You should have struck the ground five or six times. Then you would have struck down Aram until you had put an end to it. But now you will strike down Aram only three times.” 
12013020	And Elisha died and was buried. Now the Moabite raiders used to come into the land every spring. 
12013021	Once, as the Israelites were burying a man, suddenly they saw a band of raiders, so they threw the man’s body into Elisha’s tomb. And as soon as his body touched the bones of Elisha, the man was revived and stood up on his feet. 
12013022	And Hazael king of Aram oppressed Israel throughout the reign of Jehoahaz. 
12013023	But the LORD was gracious to Israel and had compassion on them, and He turned toward them because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And to this day, the LORD has been unwilling to destroy them or cast them from His presence. 
12013024	When Hazael king of Aram died, his son Ben-hadad reigned in his place. 
12013025	Then Jehoash son of Jehoahaz took back from Ben-hadad son of Hazael the cities that Hazael had taken in battle from his father Jehoahaz. Jehoash defeated Ben-hadad three times, and so recovered the cities of Israel. 
12014001	In the second year of the reign of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz over Israel, Amaziah son of Joash became king of Judah. 
12014002	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan; she was from Jerusalem. 
12014003	And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, but not as his father David had done. He did everything as his father Joash had done. 
12014004	Nevertheless, the high places were not taken away, and the people continued sacrificing and burning incense on the high places. 
12014005	As soon as the kingdom was firmly in his grasp, Amaziah executed the servants who had murdered his father the king. 
12014006	Yet he did not put the sons of the murderers to death, but acted according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, where the LORD commanded: “Fathers must not be put to death for their children, and children must not be put to death for their fathers; each is to die for his own sin.” 
12014007	Amaziah struck down 10,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. He took Sela in battle and called it Joktheel, which is its name to this very day. 
12014008	Then Amaziah sent messengers to the king of Israel Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu. “Come, let us meet face to face,” he said. 
12014009	But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah: “A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’ Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle. 
12014010	You have indeed defeated Edom, and your heart has become proud. Glory in that and stay at home. Why should you stir up trouble so that you fall—you and Judah with you?” 
12014011	But Amaziah would not listen, so Jehoash king of Israel advanced. He and King Amaziah of Judah faced each other at Beth-shemesh in Judah. 
12014012	And Judah was routed before Israel, and every man fled to his home. 
12014013	There at Beth-shemesh, Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Ahaziah. Then Jehoash went to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate—a section of four hundred cubits. 
12014014	He took all the gold and silver and all the articles found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the royal palace, as well as some hostages. Then he returned to Samaria. 
12014015	As for the rest of the acts of Jehoash, along with his accomplishments, his might, and how he waged war against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
12014016	And Jehoash rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. And his son Jeroboam reigned in his place. 
12014017	Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel. 
12014018	As for the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
12014019	And conspirators plotted against Amaziah in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But men were sent after him to Lachish, and they killed him there. 
12014020	They carried him back on horses and buried him in Jerusalem with his fathers in the City of David. 
12014021	Then all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah. 
12014022	Azariah was the one who rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah after King Amaziah rested with his fathers. 
12014023	In the fifteenth year of the reign of Amaziah son of Joash over Judah, Jeroboam son of Jehoash became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria forty-one years. 
12014024	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD and did not turn away from all the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit. 
12014025	This Jeroboam restored the boundary of Israel from Lebo-hamath to the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word that the LORD, the God of Israel, had spoken through His servant Jonah son of Amittai, the prophet from Gath-hepher. 
12014026	For the LORD saw that the affliction of the Israelites, both slave and free, was very bitter. There was no one to help Israel, 
12014027	and since the LORD had said that He would not blot out the name of Israel from under heaven, He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam son of Jehoash. 
12014028	As for the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, along with all his accomplishments and might, and how he waged war and recovered both Damascus and Hamath for Israel from Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
12014029	And Jeroboam rested with his fathers, the kings of Israel. And his son Zechariah reigned in his place. 
12015001	In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam’s reign over Israel, Azariah son of Amaziah became king of Judah. 
12015002	He was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. His mother’s name was Jecoliah; she was from Jerusalem. 
12015003	And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Amaziah had done. 
12015004	Nevertheless, the high places were not taken away; the people continued sacrificing and burning incense there. 
12015005	And the LORD afflicted the king with leprosy until the day he died, so that he lived in a separate house while his son Jotham had charge of the palace and governed the people of the land. 
12015006	As for the rest of the acts of Azariah, along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
12015007	And Azariah rested with his fathers and was buried near them in the City of David. And his son Jotham reigned in his place. 
12015008	In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah’s reign over Judah, Zechariah son of Jeroboam became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria six months. 
12015009	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done. He did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit. 
12015010	Then Shallum son of Jabesh conspired against Zechariah, struck him down and killed him in front of the people, and reigned in his place. 
12015011	As for the rest of the acts of Zechariah, they are indeed written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 
12015012	So the word of the LORD spoken to Jehu was fulfilled: “Four generations of your sons will sit on the throne of Israel.” 
12015013	In the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah’s reign over Judah, Shallum son of Jabesh became king, and he reigned in Samaria one full month. 
12015014	Then Menahem son of Gadi went up from Tirzah to Samaria, struck down and killed Shallum son of Jabesh, and reigned in his place. 
12015015	As for the rest of the acts of Shallum, along with the conspiracy he led, they are indeed written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 
12015016	At that time Menahem, starting from Tirzah, attacked Tiphsah and everyone in its vicinity, because they would not open their gates. So he attacked Tiphsah and ripped open all the pregnant women. 
12015017	In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah’s reign over Judah, Menahem son of Gadi became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria ten years. 
12015018	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and throughout his reign he did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit. 
12015019	Then Pul king of Assyria invaded the land, and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver in order to gain his support and strengthen his own grip on the kingdom. 
12015020	Menahem exacted this money from each of the wealthy men of Israel—fifty shekels of silver from each man—to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria withdrew and did not remain in the land. 
12015021	As for the rest of the acts of Menahem, along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
12015022	And Menahem rested with his fathers, and his son Pekahiah reigned in his place. 
12015023	In the fiftieth year of Azariah’s reign over Judah, Pekahiah son of Menahem became king of Israel and reigned in Samaria two years. 
12015024	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD and did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit. 
12015025	Then his officer, Pekah son of Remaliah, conspired against him along with Argob, Arieh, and fifty men of Gilead. And at the citadel of the king’s palace in Samaria, Pekah struck down and killed Pekahiah and reigned in his place. 
12015026	As for the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, along with all his accomplishments, they are indeed written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 
12015027	In the fifty-second year of Azariah’s reign over Judah, Pekah son of Remaliah became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria twenty years. 
12015028	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD and did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit. 
12015029	In the days of Pekah king of Israel, Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came and captured Ijon, Abel-beth-maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, and Galilee, including all the land of Naphtali, and he took the people as captives to Assyria. 
12015030	Then Hoshea son of Elah led a conspiracy against Pekah son of Remaliah. In the twentieth year of Jotham son of Uzziah, Hoshea attacked Pekah, killed him, and reigned in his place. 
12015031	As for the rest of the acts of Pekah, along with all his accomplishments, they are indeed written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 
12015032	In the second year of the reign of Pekah son of Remaliah over Israel, Jotham son of Uzziah became king of Judah. 
12015033	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. His mother’s name was Jerusha daughter of Zadok. 
12015034	And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Uzziah had done. 
12015035	Nevertheless, the high places were not taken away; the people continued sacrificing and burning incense there. Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the house of the LORD. 
12015036	As for the rest of the acts of Jotham, along with his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
12015037	(In those days the LORD began to send Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah against Judah.) 
12015038	And Jotham rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David his father. And his son Ahaz reigned in his place. 
12016001	In the seventeenth year of Pekah son of Remaliah, Ahaz son of Jotham became king of Judah. 
12016002	Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. And unlike David his father, he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD his God. 
12016003	Instead, he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and even sacrificed his son in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites. 
12016004	And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree. 
12016005	Then Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to wage war against Jerusalem. They besieged Ahaz but could not overcome him. 
12016006	At that time Rezin king of Aram recovered Elath for Aram, drove out the men of Judah, and sent the Edomites into Elath, where they live to this day. 
12016007	So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your son. Come up and save me from the hands of the kings of Aram and Israel, who are rising up against me.” 
12016008	Ahaz also took the silver and gold found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king’s palace, and he sent it as a gift to the king of Assyria. 
12016009	So the king of Assyria responded to him, marched up to Damascus, and captured it. He took its people to Kir as captives and put Rezin to death. 
12016010	Then King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria. On seeing the altar in Damascus, King Ahaz sent Uriah the priest a model of the altar and complete plans for its construction. 
12016011	And Uriah the priest built the altar according to all the instructions King Ahaz had sent from Damascus, and he completed it before King Ahaz returned. 
12016012	When the king came back from Damascus and saw the altar, he approached it and presented offerings on it. 
12016013	He offered his burnt offering and his grain offering, poured out his drink offering, and splattered the blood of his peace offerings on the altar. 
12016014	He also took the bronze altar that stood before the LORD from the front of the temple (between the new altar and the house of the LORD) and he put it on the north side of the new altar. 
12016015	Then King Ahaz commanded Uriah the priest, “Offer on the great altar the morning burnt offering, the evening grain offering, and the king’s burnt offering and grain offering, as well as the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings of all the people of the land. Splatter on the altar all the blood of the burnt offerings and sacrifices. But I will use the bronze altar to seek guidance.” 
12016016	So Uriah the priest did just as King Ahaz had commanded. 
12016017	King Ahaz also cut off the frames of the movable stands and removed the bronze basin from each of them. He took down the Sea from the bronze oxen that were under it and put it on a stone base. 
12016018	And on account of the king of Assyria, he removed the Sabbath canopy they had built in the temple and closed the royal entryway outside the house of the LORD. 
12016019	As for the rest of the acts of Ahaz, along with his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
12016020	And Ahaz rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David, and his son Hezekiah reigned in his place. 
12017001	In the twelfth year of the reign of Ahaz over Judah, Hoshea son of Elah became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria nine years. 
12017002	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, but not like the kings of Israel who preceded him. 
12017003	Shalmaneser king of Assyria attacked him, and Hoshea became his vassal and paid him tribute. 
12017004	But the king of Assyria discovered that Hoshea had conspired to send envoys to King So of Egypt, and that he had not paid tribute to the king of Assyria as in previous years. Therefore the king of Assyria arrested Hoshea and put him in prison. 
12017005	Then the king of Assyria invaded the whole land, marched up to Samaria, and besieged it for three years. 
12017006	In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and carried away the Israelites to Assyria, where he settled them in Halah, in Gozan by the Habor River, and in the cities of the Medes. 
12017007	All this happened because the people of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. They had worshiped other gods 
12017008	and walked in the customs of the nations that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites, as well as in the practices introduced by the kings of Israel. 
12017009	The Israelites secretly did things against the LORD their God that were not right. From watchtower to fortified city, they built high places in all their cities. 
12017010	They set up for themselves sacred pillars and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree. 
12017011	They burned incense on all the high places like the nations that the LORD had driven out before them. They did wicked things, provoking the LORD to anger. 
12017012	They served idols, although the LORD had told them, “You shall not do this thing.” 
12017013	Yet through all His prophets and seers, the LORD warned Israel and Judah, saying, “Turn from your wicked ways and keep My commandments and statutes, according to the entire Law that I commanded your fathers and delivered to you through My servants the prophets.” 
12017014	But they would not listen, and they stiffened their necks like their fathers, who did not believe the LORD their God. 
12017015	They rejected His statutes and the covenant He had made with their fathers, as well as the decrees He had given them. They pursued worthless idols and became worthless themselves, going after the surrounding nations that the LORD had commanded them not to imitate. 
12017016	They abandoned all the commandments of the LORD their God and made for themselves two cast idols of calves and an Asherah pole. They bowed down to all the host of heaven and served Baal. 
12017017	They sacrificed their sons and daughters in the fire and practiced divination and soothsaying. They devoted themselves to doing evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger. 
12017018	So the LORD was very angry with Israel, and He removed them from His presence. Only the tribe of Judah remained, 
12017019	and even Judah did not keep the commandments of the LORD their God, but lived according to the customs Israel had introduced. 
12017020	So the LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel. He afflicted them and delivered them into the hands of plunderers, until He had banished them from His presence. 
12017021	When the LORD had torn Israel away from the house of David, they made Jeroboam son of Nebat king, and Jeroboam led Israel away from following the LORD and caused them to commit a great sin. 
12017022	The Israelites persisted in all the sins that Jeroboam had committed and did not turn away from them. 
12017023	Finally, the LORD removed Israel from His presence, as He had declared through all His servants the prophets. So Israel was exiled from their homeland into Assyria, where they are to this day. 
12017024	Then the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim and settled them in the towns of Samaria to replace the Israelites. They took possession of Samaria and lived in its towns. 
12017025	Now when the settlers first lived there, they did not worship the LORD, so He sent lions among them, which killed some of them. 
12017026	So they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, “The peoples that you have removed and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the requirements of the God of the land. Because of this, He has sent lions among them, which are indeed killing them off.” 
12017027	Then the king of Assyria commanded: “Send back one of the priests you carried off from Samaria, and have him go back to live there and teach the requirements of the God of the land.” 
12017028	Thus one of the priests they had carried away came and lived in Bethel, and he began to teach them how they should worship the LORD. 
12017029	Nevertheless, the people of each nation continued to make their own gods in the cities where they had settled, and they set them up in the shrines that the people of Samaria had made on the high places. 
12017030	The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima, 
12017031	the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech the gods of Sepharvaim. 
12017032	So the new residents worshiped the LORD, but they also appointed for themselves priests of all sorts to serve in the shrines of the high places. 
12017033	They worshiped the LORD, but they also served their own gods according to the customs of the nations from which they had been carried away. 
12017034	To this day they are still practicing their former customs. None of them worship the LORD or observe the statutes, ordinances, laws, and commandments that the LORD gave the descendants of Jacob, whom He named Israel. 
12017035	For the LORD had made a covenant with the Israelites and commanded them, “Do not worship other gods or bow down to them; do not serve them or sacrifice to them. 
12017036	Instead, worship the LORD, who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm. You are to bow down to Him and offer sacrifices to Him. 
12017037	And you must always be careful to observe the statutes, ordinances, laws, and commandments He wrote for you. Do not worship other gods. 
12017038	Do not forget the covenant I have made with you. Do not worship other gods, 
12017039	but worship the LORD your God, and He will deliver you from the hands of all your enemies.” 
12017040	But they would not listen, and they persisted in their former customs. 
12017041	So these nations worshiped the LORD but also served their idols, and to this day their children and grandchildren continue to do as their fathers did. 
12018001	In the third year of the reign of Hoshea son of Elah over Israel, Hezekiah son of Ahaz became king of Judah. 
12018002	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Abi, the daughter of Zechariah. 
12018003	And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father David had done. 
12018004	He removed the high places, shattered the sacred pillars, and cut down the Asherah poles. He also demolished the bronze snake called Nehushtan that Moses had made, for up to that time the Israelites had burned incense to it. 
12018005	Hezekiah trusted in the LORD, the God of Israel. No king of Judah was like him, either before him or after him. 
12018006	He remained faithful to the LORD and did not turn from following Him; he kept the commandments that the LORD had given Moses. 
12018007	And the LORD was with Hezekiah, and he prospered wherever he went. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and refused to serve him. 
12018008	He defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza and its borders, from watchtower to fortified city. 
12018009	In the fourth year of Hezekiah’s reign, which was the seventh year of the reign of Hoshea son of Elah over Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria marched against Samaria and besieged it. 
12018010	And at the end of three years, the Assyrians captured it. So Samaria was captured in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel. 
12018011	The king of Assyria exiled the Israelites to Assyria and settled them in Halah, in Gozan by the Habor River, and in the cities of the Medes. 
12018012	This happened because they did not listen to the voice of the LORD their God, but violated His covenant—all that Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded—and would neither listen nor obey. 
12018013	In the fourteenth year of Hezekiah’s reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked and captured all the fortified cities of Judah. 
12018014	So Hezekiah king of Judah sent word to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, “I have done wrong; withdraw from me, and I will pay whatever you demand from me.” And the king of Assyria exacted from Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. 
12018015	Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the royal palace. 
12018016	At that time Hezekiah stripped the gold with which he had plated the doors and doorposts of the temple of the LORD, and he gave it to the king of Assyria. 
12018017	Nevertheless, the king of Assyria sent the Tartan, the Rabsaris, and the Rabshakeh, along with a great army, from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. They advanced up to Jerusalem and stationed themselves by the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field. 
12018018	Then they called for the king. And Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebnah the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder, went out to them. 
12018019	The Rabshakeh said to them, “Tell Hezekiah that this is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: What is the basis of this confidence of yours? 
12018020	You claim to have a strategy and strength for war, but these are empty words. In whom are you now trusting, that you have rebelled against me? 
12018021	Look now, you are trusting in Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff that will pierce the hand of anyone who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him. 
12018022	But if you say to me, ‘We trust in the LORD our God,’ is He not the One whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem: ‘You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem’? 
12018023	Now, therefore, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria. I will give you two thousand horses—if you can put riders on them! 
12018024	For how can you repel a single officer among the least of my master’s servants when you depend on Egypt for chariots and horsemen? 
12018025	So now, was it apart from the LORD that I have come up against this place to destroy it? The LORD Himself said to me, ‘Go up against this land and destroy it.’” 
12018026	Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, along with Shebnah and Joah, said to the Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Do not speak with us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall.” 
12018027	But the Rabshakeh replied, “Has my master sent me to speak these words only to you and your master, and not to the men sitting on the wall, who are destined with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?” 
12018028	Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out loudly in Hebrew: “Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria! 
12018029	This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you; he cannot deliver you from my hand. 
12018030	Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the LORD when he says, ‘The LORD will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.’ 
12018031	Do not listen to Hezekiah, for this is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and his own fig tree and drink water from his own cistern, 
12018032	until I come and take you away to a land like your own—a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey—so that you may live and not die. But do not listen to Hezekiah, for he misleads you when he says, ‘The LORD will deliver us.’ 
12018033	Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria? 
12018034	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand? 
12018035	Who among all the gods of these lands has delivered his land from my hand? How then can the LORD deliver Jerusalem from my hand?” 
12018036	But the people remained silent and did not answer a word, for Hezekiah had commanded, “Do not answer him.” 
12018037	Then Hilkiah’s son Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the scribe, and Asaph’s son Joah the recorder came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and they relayed to him the words of the Rabshakeh. 
12019001	On hearing this report, King Hezekiah tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and entered the house of the LORD. 
12019002	And he sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the scribe, and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz 
12019003	to tell him, “This is what Hezekiah says: Today is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace; for children have come to the point of birth, but there is no strength to deliver them. 
12019004	Perhaps the LORD your God will hear all the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to defy the living God, and He will rebuke him for the words that the LORD your God has heard. Therefore lift up a prayer for the remnant that still survives.” 
12019005	So the servants of King Hezekiah went to Isaiah, 
12019006	who replied, “Tell your master that this is what the LORD says: ‘Do not be afraid of the words you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me. 
12019007	Behold, I will put a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own land, where I will cause him to fall by the sword.’” 
12019008	When the Rabshakeh heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah. 
12019009	Now Sennacherib had been warned about Tirhakah king of Cush: “Look, he has set out to fight against you.” So Sennacherib again sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, 
12019010	“Give this message to Hezekiah king of Judah: ‘Do not let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you by saying that Jerusalem will not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. 
12019011	Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the other countries, devoting them to destruction. Will you then be spared? 
12019012	Did the gods of the nations destroyed by my fathers rescue those nations—the gods of Gozan, Haran, and Rezeph, and of the people of Eden in Telassar? 
12019013	Where are the kings of Hamath, Arpad, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?’” 
12019014	So Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers, read it, and went up to the house of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD. 
12019015	And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD: “O LORD, God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, You alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You made the heavens and the earth. 
12019016	Incline Your ear, O LORD, and hear; open Your eyes, O LORD, and see. Listen to the words that Sennacherib has sent to defy the living God. 
12019017	Truly, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste these nations and their lands. 
12019018	They have cast their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods, but only wood and stone—the work of human hands. 
12019019	And now, O LORD our God, please save us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone, O LORD, are God.” 
12019020	Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah: “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I have heard your prayer concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria. 
12019021	This is the word that the LORD has spoken against him: ‘The Virgin Daughter of Zion despises you and mocks you; the Daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head behind you. 
12019022	Whom have you taunted and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel! 
12019023	Through your servants you have taunted the Lord, and you have said: “With my many chariots I have ascended to the heights of the mountains, to the remote peaks of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars, the finest of its cypresses. I have reached its farthest outposts, the densest of its forests. 
12019024	I have dug wells and drunk foreign waters. With the soles of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.” 
12019025	Have you not heard? Long ago I ordained it; in days of old I planned it. Now I have brought it to pass, that you should crush fortified cities into piles of rubble. 
12019026	Therefore their inhabitants, devoid of power, are dismayed and ashamed. They are like plants in the field, tender green shoots, grass on the rooftops, scorched before it is grown. 
12019027	But I know your sitting down, your going out and coming in, and your raging against Me. 
12019028	Because your rage and arrogance against Me have reached My ears, I will put My hook in your nose and My bit in your mouth; I will send you back the way you came.’ 
12019029	And this will be a sign to you, O Hezekiah: This year you will eat what grows on its own, and in the second year what springs from the same. But in the third year you will sow and reap; you will plant vineyards and eat their fruit. 
12019030	And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root below and bear fruit above. 
12019031	For a remnant will go forth from Jerusalem, and survivors from Mount Zion. The zeal of the LORD of Hosts will accomplish this. 
12019032	So this is what the LORD says about the king of Assyria: ‘He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow into it. He will not come before it with a shield or build up a siege ramp against it. 
12019033	He will go back the way he came, and he will not enter this city, declares the LORD. 
12019034	I will defend this city and save it for My own sake and for the sake of My servant David.’” 
12019035	And that very night the angel of the LORD went out and struck down 185,000 men in the camp of the Assyrians. When the people got up the next morning, there were all the dead bodies! 
12019036	So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there. 
12019037	One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer put him to the sword and escaped to the land of Ararat. And his son Esar-haddon reigned in his place. 
12020001	In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came to him and said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Put your house in order, for you are about to die; you will not recover.’” 
12020002	Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD, saying, 
12020003	“Please, O LORD, remember how I have walked before You faithfully and with wholehearted devotion; I have done what is good in Your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly. 
12020004	Before Isaiah had left the middle courtyard, the word of the LORD came to him, saying, 
12020005	“Go back and tell Hezekiah the leader of My people that this is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says: ‘I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. I will surely heal you. On the third day from now you will go up to the house of the LORD. 
12020006	I will add fifteen years to your life. And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city for My sake and for the sake of My servant David.’” 
12020007	Then Isaiah said, “Prepare a poultice of figs.” So they brought it and applied it to the boil, and Hezekiah recovered. 
12020008	Now Hezekiah had asked Isaiah, “What will be the sign that the LORD will heal me and that I will go up to the house of the LORD on the third day?” 
12020009	And Isaiah had replied, “This will be a sign to you from the LORD that He will do what He has promised: Would you like the shadow to go forward ten steps, or back ten steps?” 
12020010	“It is easy for the shadow to lengthen ten steps,” answered Hezekiah, “but not for it to go back ten steps.” 
12020011	So Isaiah the prophet called out to the LORD, and He brought the shadow back the ten steps it had descended on the stairway of Ahaz. 
12020012	At that time Merodach-baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard about Hezekiah’s illness. 
12020013	And Hezekiah received the envoys and showed them all that was in his treasure house—the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil, as well as his armory—all that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing in his palace or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them. 
12020014	Then the prophet Isaiah went to King Hezekiah and asked, “Where did those men come from, and what did they say to you?” “They came from a distant land,” Hezekiah replied, “from Babylon.” 
12020015	“What have they seen in your palace?” Isaiah asked. “They have seen everything in my palace,” answered Hezekiah. “There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them.” 
12020016	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the LORD: 
12020017	The time will surely come when everything in your palace and all that your fathers have stored up until this day will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the LORD. 
12020018	And some of your descendants, your own flesh and blood, will be taken away to be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.” 
12020019	But Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the LORD that you have spoken is good.” For he thought, “Will there not at least be peace and security in my lifetime?” 
12020020	As for the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, along with all his might and how he constructed the pool and the tunnel to bring water into the city, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
12020021	And Hezekiah rested with his fathers, and his son Manasseh reigned in his place. 
12021001	Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years. His mother’s name was Hephzibah. 
12021002	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD by following the abominations of the nations that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites. 
12021003	For he rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed, and he raised up altars for Baal. He made an Asherah pole, as King Ahab of Israel had done, and he worshiped and served all the host of heaven. 
12021004	Manasseh also built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, “In Jerusalem I will put My Name.” 
12021005	In both courtyards of the house of the LORD, he built altars to all the host of heaven. 
12021006	He sacrificed his own son in the fire, practiced sorcery and divination, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did great evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger. 
12021007	Manasseh even took the carved Asherah pole he had made and set it up in the temple, of which the LORD had said to David and his son Solomon, “In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will establish My Name forever. 
12021008	I will never again cause the feet of the Israelites to wander from the land that I gave to their fathers, if only they are careful to do all I have commanded them—the whole Law that My servant Moses commanded them.” 
12021009	But the people did not listen and Manasseh led them astray, so that they did greater evil than the nations that the LORD had destroyed before the Israelites. 
12021010	And the LORD spoke through His servants the prophets, saying, 
12021011	“Since Manasseh king of Judah has committed all these abominations, acting more wickedly than the Amorites who preceded him, and with his idols has caused Judah to sin, 
12021012	this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I am bringing such calamity upon Jerusalem and Judah that the news will reverberate in the ears of all who hear it. 
12021013	I will stretch out over Jerusalem the measuring line used against Samaria and the plumb line used against the house of Ahab, and I will wipe out Jerusalem as one wipes out a bowl—wiping it and turning it upside down. 
12021014	So I will forsake the remnant of My inheritance and deliver them into the hands of their enemies. And they will become plunder and spoil to all their enemies, 
12021015	because they have done evil in My sight and have provoked Me to anger from the day their fathers came out of Egypt until this day.’” 
12021016	Moreover, Manasseh shed so much innocent blood that he filled Jerusalem from end to end, in addition to the sin that he had caused Judah to commit, doing evil in the sight of the LORD. 
12021017	As for the rest of the acts of Manasseh, along with all his accomplishments and the sin that he committed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
12021018	And Manasseh rested with his fathers and was buried in his palace garden, the garden of Uzza. And his son Amon reigned in his place. 
12021019	Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem two years. His mother’s name was Meshullemeth daughter of Haruz; she was from Jotbah. 
12021020	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh had done. 
12021021	He walked in all the ways of his father, and he served and worshiped the idols his father had served. 
12021022	He abandoned the LORD, the God of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of the LORD. 
12021023	Then the servants of Amon conspired against him and killed the king in his palace. 
12021024	But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and they made his son Josiah king in his place. 
12021025	As for the rest of the acts of Amon, along with his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
12021026	And he was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza, and his son Josiah reigned in his place. 
12022001	Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years. His mother’s name was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah; she was from Bozkath. 
12022002	And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD and walked in all the ways of his father David; he did not turn aside to the right or to the left. 
12022003	Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, King Josiah sent the scribe, Shaphan son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, to the house of the LORD, saying, 
12022004	“Go up to Hilkiah the high priest and have him count the money that has been brought into the house of the LORD, which the doorkeepers have collected from the people. 
12022005	And let them deliver it into the hands of the supervisors of those doing the work on the house of the LORD, who in turn are to give it to the workmen repairing the damages to the house of the LORD— 
12022006	to the carpenters, builders, and masons—to buy timber and dressed stone to repair the temple. 
12022007	But they need not account for the money put into their hands, since they work with integrity.” 
12022008	Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the LORD!” And he gave it to Shaphan, who read it. 
12022009	And Shaphan the scribe went to the king and reported, “Your servants have paid out the money that was found in the temple and have put it into the hands of the workers and supervisors of the house of the LORD.” 
12022010	Moreover, Shaphan the scribe told the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read it in the presence of the king. 
12022011	When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his clothes 
12022012	and commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Achbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the servant of the king: 
12022013	“Go and inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah concerning the words in this book that has been found. For great is the wrath of the LORD that burns against us because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book by doing all that is written about us.” 
12022014	So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went and spoke to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, the keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem, in the Second District. 
12022015	And Huldah said to them, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Tell the man who sent you 
12022016	that this is what the LORD says: I am about to bring calamity on this place and on its people, according to all the words of the book that the king of Judah has read, 
12022017	because they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands. My wrath will be kindled against this place and will not be quenched.’ 
12022018	But as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, tell him that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘As for the words that you heard, 
12022019	because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before the LORD when you heard what I spoke against this place and against its people, that they would become a desolation and a curse, and because you have torn your clothes and wept before Me, I have heard you,’ declares the LORD. 
12022020	‘Therefore I will indeed gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace. Your eyes will not see all the calamity that I will bring on this place.’” So they brought her answer back to the king. 
12023001	Then the king summoned all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 
12023002	And he went up to the house of the LORD with all the people of Judah and Jerusalem, as well as the priests and the prophets—all the people small and great—and in their hearing he read all the words of the Book of the Covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. 
12023003	So the king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD to follow the LORD and to keep His commandments, decrees, and statutes with all his heart and all his soul, and to carry out the words of the covenant that were written in this book. And all the people entered into the covenant. 
12023004	Then the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, the priests second in rank, and the doorkeepers to remove from the temple of the LORD all the articles made for Baal, Asherah, and all the host of heaven. And he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron and carried their ashes to Bethel. 
12023005	Josiah also did away with the idolatrous priests ordained by the kings of Judah to burn incense on the high places of the cities of Judah and in the places all around Jerusalem—those who had burned incense to Baal, to the sun and moon, to the constellations, and to all the host of heaven. 
12023006	He brought the Asherah pole from the house of the LORD to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem, and there he burned it, ground it to powder, and threw its dust on the graves of the common people. 
12023007	He also tore down the quarters of the male shrine prostitutes that were in the house of the LORD, where the women had woven tapestries for Asherah. 
12023008	Then Josiah brought all the priests from the cities of Judah and desecrated the high places, from Geba to Beersheba, where the priests had burned incense. He tore down the high places of the gates at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which was to the left of the city gate. 
12023009	Although the priests of the high places did not come up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, they ate unleavened bread with their fellow priests. 
12023010	He also desecrated Topheth in the Valley of Ben-hinnom so that no one could sacrifice his son or daughter in the fire to Molech. 
12023011	And he removed from the entrance to the house of the LORD the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun. They were in the court near the chamber of an official named Nathan-melech. And Josiah burned up the chariots of the sun. 
12023012	He pulled down the altars that the kings of Judah had set up on the roof near the upper chamber of Ahaz, and the altars that Manasseh had set up in the two courtyards of the house of the LORD. The king pulverized them there and threw their dust into the Kidron Valley. 
12023013	The king also desecrated the high places east of Jerusalem, to the south of the Mount of Corruption, which King Solomon of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. 
12023014	He smashed the sacred pillars to pieces, cut down the Asherah poles, and covered the sites with human bones. 
12023015	He even pulled down the altar at Bethel, the high place set up by Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin. Then he burned the high place, ground it to powder, and burned the Asherah pole. 
12023016	And as Josiah turned, he saw the tombs there on the hillside, and he sent someone to take the bones out of the tombs, and he burned them on the altar to defile it, according to the word of the LORD proclaimed by the man of God who had foretold these things. 
12023017	Then the king asked, “What is this monument I see?” And the men of the city replied, “It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things that you have done to the altar of Bethel.” 
12023018	“Let him rest,” said Josiah. “Do not let anyone disturb his bones.” So they left his bones undisturbed, along with those of the prophet who had come from Samaria. 
12023019	Just as Josiah had done at Bethel, so also in the cities of Samaria he removed all the shrines of the high places set up by the kings of Israel who had provoked the LORD to anger. 
12023020	On the altars he slaughtered all the priests of the high places, and he burned human bones on them. Then he returned to Jerusalem. 
12023021	The king commanded all the people, “Keep the Passover of the LORD your God, as it is written in this Book of the Covenant.” 
12023022	No such Passover had been observed from the days of the judges who had governed Israel through all the days of the kings of Israel and Judah. 
12023023	But in the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign, this Passover was observed to the LORD in Jerusalem. 
12023024	Furthermore, Josiah removed the mediums and spiritists, the household gods and idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem. He did this to carry out the words of the law written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had found in the house of the LORD. 
12023025	Neither before nor after Josiah was there any king like him, who turned to the LORD with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength, according to all the Law of Moses. 
12023026	Nevertheless, the LORD did not turn away from the fury of His burning anger, which was kindled against Judah because of all that Manasseh had done to provoke Him to anger. 
12023027	For the LORD had said, “I will remove Judah from My sight, just as I removed Israel. I will reject this city Jerusalem, which I chose, and the temple of which I said, ‘My Name shall be there.’” 
12023028	As for the rest of the acts of Josiah and all his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
12023029	During Josiah’s reign, Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt marched up to help the king of Assyria at the Euphrates River. King Josiah went out to confront him, but Neco faced him and killed him at Megiddo. 
12023030	From Megiddo his servants carried his body in a chariot, brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah, anointed him, and made him king in place of his father. 
12023031	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah. 
12023032	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, just as his fathers had done. 
12023033	And Pharaoh Neco imprisoned Jehoahaz at Riblah in the land of Hamath so that he could not reign in Jerusalem, and he imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold. 
12023034	Then Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim son of Josiah king in place of his father Josiah, and he changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took Jehoahaz and carried him off to Egypt, where he died. 
12023035	So Jehoiakim paid the silver and gold to Pharaoh Neco, but to meet Pharaoh’s demand he taxed the land and exacted the silver and the gold from the people, each according to his wealth. 
12023036	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother’s name was Zebidah daughter of Pedaiah; she was from Rumah. 
12023037	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, just as his fathers had done. 
12024001	During Jehoiakim’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded. So Jehoiakim became his vassal for three years, until he turned and rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar. 
12024002	And the LORD sent Chaldean, Aramean, Moabite, and Ammonite raiders against Jehoiakim in order to destroy Judah, according to the word that the LORD had spoken through His servants the prophets. 
12024003	Surely this happened to Judah at the LORD’s command, to remove them from His presence because of the sins of Manasseh and all that he had done, 
12024004	and also for the innocent blood he had shed. For he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the LORD was unwilling to forgive. 
12024005	As for the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
12024006	And Jehoiakim rested with his fathers, and his son Jehoiachin reigned in his place. 
12024007	Now the king of Egypt did not march out of his land again, because the king of Babylon had taken all his territory, from the Brook of Egypt to the Euphrates River. 
12024008	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother’s name was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan; she was from Jerusalem. 
12024009	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, just as his father had done. 
12024010	At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched up to Jerusalem, and the city came under siege. 
12024011	And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to the city while his servants were besieging it. 
12024012	Jehoiachin king of Judah, his mother, his servants, his commanders, and his officials all surrendered to the king of Babylon. So in the eighth year of his reign, the king of Babylon took him captive. 
12024013	As the LORD had declared, Nebuchadnezzar also carried off all the treasures from the house of the LORD and the royal palace, and he cut into pieces all the gold articles that Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD. 
12024014	He carried into exile all Jerusalem—all the commanders and mighty men of valor, all the craftsmen and metalsmiths—ten thousand captives in all. Only the poorest people of the land remained. 
12024015	Nebuchadnezzar carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, as well as the king’s mother, his wives, his officials, and the leading men of the land. He took them into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon. 
12024016	The king of Babylon also brought into exile to Babylon all seven thousand men of valor and a thousand craftsmen and metalsmiths—all strong and fit for battle. 
12024017	Then the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s uncle, king in his place and changed his name to Zedekiah. 
12024018	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah. 
12024019	And Zedekiah did evil in the sight of the LORD, just as Jehoiakim had done. 
12024020	For because of the anger of the LORD, all this happened in Jerusalem and Judah, until He finally banished them from His presence. And Zedekiah also rebelled against the king of Babylon. 
12025001	So in the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his entire army. They encamped outside the city and built a siege wall all around it. 
12025002	And the city was kept under siege until King Zedekiah’s eleventh year. 
12025003	By the ninth day of the fourth month, the famine in the city was so severe that the people of the land had no food. 
12025004	Then the city was breached; and though the Chaldeans had surrounded the city, all the men of war fled by night by way of the gate between the two walls near the king’s garden. They headed toward the Arabah, 
12025005	but the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho, and his whole army deserted him. 
12025006	The Chaldeans seized the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, where they pronounced judgment on him. 
12025007	And they slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. Then they put out his eyes, bound him with bronze shackles, and took him to Babylon. 
12025008	On the seventh day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign over Babylon, Nebuzaradan captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, entered Jerusalem. 
12025009	He burned down the house of the LORD, the royal palace, and all the houses of Jerusalem—every significant building. 
12025010	And the whole army of the Chaldeans under the captain of the guard broke down the walls around Jerusalem. 
12025011	Then Nebuzaradan captain of the guard carried into exile the people who remained in the city, along with the deserters who had defected to the king of Babylon and the rest of the population. 
12025012	But the captain of the guard left behind some of the poorest of the land to tend the vineyards and fields. 
12025013	Moreover, the Chaldeans broke up the bronze pillars and stands and the bronze Sea in the house of the LORD, and they carried the bronze to Babylon. 
12025014	They also took away the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, dishes, and all the articles of bronze used in the temple service. 
12025015	The captain of the guard also took away the censers and sprinkling bowls—anything made of pure gold or fine silver. 
12025016	As for the two pillars, the Sea, and the movable stands that Solomon had made for the house of the LORD, the weight of the bronze from all these articles was beyond measure. 
12025017	Each pillar was eighteen cubits tall. The bronze capital atop one pillar was three cubits high, with a network of bronze pomegranates all around. The second pillar, with its network, was similar. 
12025018	The captain of the guard also took away Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest of second rank, and the three doorkeepers. 
12025019	Of those still in the city, he took a court official who had been appointed over the men of war, as well as five royal advisors. He also took the scribe of the captain of the army, who had enlisted the people of the land, and sixty men who were found in the city. 
12025020	Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
12025021	There at Riblah in the land of Hamath, the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death. So Judah was taken into exile, away from its own land. 
12025022	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, over the people he had left behind in the land of Judah. 
12025023	When all the commanders of the armies and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as governor, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah son of the Maacathite, as well as their men. 
12025024	And Gedaliah took an oath before them and their men, assuring them, “Do not be afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you.” 
12025025	In the seventh month, however, Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who was a member of the royal family, came with ten men and struck down and killed Gedaliah, along with the Judeans and Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah. 
12025026	Then all the people small and great, together with the commanders of the army, arose and fled to Egypt for fear of the Chaldeans. 
12025027	On the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month of the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Judah’s King Jehoiachin, in the year Evil-merodach became king of Babylon, he released King Jehoiachin of Judah from prison. 
12025028	And he spoke kindly to Jehoiachin and set his throne above the thrones of the other kings who were with him in Babylon. 
12025029	So Jehoiachin changed out of his prison clothes, and he dined regularly at the king’s table for the rest of his life. 
12025030	And the king provided Jehoiachin a daily portion for the rest of his life. 
13001001	Adam, Seth, Enosh, 
13001002	Kenan, Mahalalel, Jared, 
13001003	Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech, Noah. 
13001004	The sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 
13001005	The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. 
13001006	The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. 
13001007	And the sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, the Kittites, and the Rodanites. 
13001008	The sons of Ham: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan. 
13001009	The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabta, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan. 
13001010	Cush was the father of Nimrod, who began to be a mighty one on the earth. 
13001011	Mizraim was the father of the Ludites, the Anamites, the Lehabites, the Naphtuhites, 
13001012	the Pathrusites, the Casluhites (from whom the Philistines came), and the Caphtorites. 
13001013	And Canaan was the father of Sidon his firstborn, and of the Hittites, 
13001014	the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, 
13001015	the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, 
13001016	the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. 
13001017	The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram. The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Meshech. 
13001018	Arphaxad was the father of Shelah, and Shelah was the father of Eber. 
13001019	Two sons were born to Eber: One was named Peleg, because in his days the earth was divided, and his brother was named Joktan. 
13001020	And Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 
13001021	Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 
13001022	Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 
13001023	Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were sons of Joktan. 
13001024	So from Shem came Arphaxad, Shelah, 
13001025	Eber, Peleg, Reu, 
13001026	Serug, Nahor, Terah, 
13001027	and Abram (that is, Abraham). 
13001028	The sons of Abraham were Isaac and Ishmael. 
13001029	These are their genealogies: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 
13001030	Mishma, Dumah, Massa, Hadad, Tema, 
13001031	Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. These were the sons of Ishmael. 
13001032	The sons born to Keturah, Abraham’s concubine: Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. The sons of Jokshan: Sheba and Dedan. 
13001033	The sons of Midian: Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All of these were Keturah’s sons. 
13001034	Abraham was the father of Isaac. The sons of Isaac: Esau and Israel. 
13001035	The sons of Esau: Eliphaz, Reuel, Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. 
13001036	The sons of Eliphaz: Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz; and by Timna, Amalek. 
13001037	The sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. 
13001038	The sons of Seir: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. 
13001039	The sons of Lotan: Hori and Homam. Timna was Lotan’s sister. 
13001040	The sons of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. The sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah. 
13001041	The son of Anah: Dishon. The sons of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran. 
13001042	The sons of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan. The sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran. 
13001043	These are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the Israelites: Bela son of Beor. His city was named Dinhabah. 
13001044	When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah reigned in his place. 
13001045	When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites reigned in his place. 
13001046	When Husham died, Hadad son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the country of Moab, reigned in his place. And the name of his city was Avith. 
13001047	When Hadad died, Samlah from Masrekah reigned in his place. 
13001048	When Samlah died, Shaul from Rehoboth on the Euphrates reigned in his place. 
13001049	When Shaul died, Baal-hanan son of Achbor reigned in his place. 
13001050	When Baal-hanan died, Hadad reigned in his place. His city was named Pau, and his wife’s name was Mehetabel daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-zahab. 
13001051	Then Hadad died. Now the chiefs of Edom were Timna, Alvah, Jetheth, 
13001052	Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon, 
13001053	Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar, 
13001054	Magdiel, and Iram. These were the chiefs of Edom. 
13002001	These were the sons of Israel: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, 
13002002	Dan, Joseph, Benjamin, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. 
13002003	The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, and Shelah. These three were born to him by Bath-shua the Canaanite. Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD. So the LORD put him to death. 
13002004	Tamar, Judah’s daughter-in-law, bore to him Perez and Zerah. Judah had five sons in all. 
13002005	The sons of Perez: Hezron and Hamul. 
13002006	The sons of Zerah: Zimri, Ethan, Heman, Calcol, and Dara —five in all. 
13002007	The son of Carmi: Achar, who brought trouble upon Israel by violating the ban on devoted things. 
13002008	The son of Ethan: Azariah. 
13002009	The sons who were born to Hezron: Jerahmeel, Ram, and Caleb. 
13002010	Ram was the father of Amminadab, and Amminadab was the father of Nahshon, a leader of the descendants of Judah. 
13002011	Nahshon was the father of Salmon, and Salmon was the father of Boaz. 
13002012	Boaz was the father of Obed, and Obed was the father of Jesse. 
13002013	Jesse was the father of Eliab his firstborn; Abinadab was born second, Shimea third, 
13002014	Nethanel fourth, Raddai fifth, 
13002015	Ozem sixth, and David seventh.
